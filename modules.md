# DNDUET Add-on Modules
The _dnduet_ system isn't just flexible, it's also extensible. There are many possibilities for customized rules to tailor your game to the experience that fits you and your player(s).

## Magical Systems


## Sex
While not all players of _dnduet_ will be comfortable including the following rules in their game, it can be a healthy and fulfilling way to experience sexual fantasies in a safe setting. 

## Pregnancy
Whether or not you're including the "behind the black" rules for sex in your campaign, you might find it interesting to include mechanics around the possibility of your characters becoming pregnant. This might not work for you, depending on the setting you're going for, but interesting stories can arise from the sudden life-changing event of creating a new person. These rules can also be tweaked for darker purposes, i.e. parasitic alien implantation or prolonged possession.

If a character has come under risk of pregnancy, roll `1d20`:

- If you roll a 20, you're pregnant!
- If you roll a 19 and your character is 20-40 years old, you're pregnant!
- If you roll an 18 and your character is 20-30, you're pregnant!
- If you roll a 17 and your character is 20-25 years old, you're pregnant!
- If you roll between 2 and 16, your character is not pregnant.
- If you roll a 1, you're sterile and will require magical, scientific, or divine intervention to become pregnant.

### Contraceptives
If your character specifically uses contraceptives, roll an extra `1d20` for each method of contraception used and use the lowest roll result.

### Immaculate Conception
Curses, magical tricksters, flirty deities, or whatever else you're comfortable including in your game might cause your player to become pregnant without sex. Regardless, roll as normal and follow the conditions above.

### Progression
You may want to talk with your player about how a pregnancy will affect the flow of the narrative. Will you track the progress and work it into the story? Find a witch to speed up the birth so you can get back on the road with your new bundle of love? Find a safe place to hunker down and skip several months of peacefully preparing? It's totally up to you and your player(s) to decide, different people find different things fun.
