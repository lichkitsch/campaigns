# DNDUET Add-on Modules
The _dnduet_ system isn't just flexible, it's also extensible. There are many possibilities for customized rules to tailor your game to the experience that fits you and your player(s).

## Index


## Travel
Moving from place to place is rarely uneventful! Plan for travel by having your player roll `1d4+1d6` and using the following table:

| Result | Outcome |
|:---:|:--- |
| 8-10 | Easy breezy: moment of joy, comfortable weather, possibility for treasure or secrets |
| 5-7 | Typical travels: pay a toll for safe passage, followed by animals looking for food, etc. |
| 2-4 | Tough times: broken gear, twisted ankles, bandits and kobolds and bears, oh my! |

Tailor the possible results to your setting and save the unused results for another time. Travel rolls will depend on the range of your campaign; it could be walking between several city blocks, crossing a river, or navigating an entire forest.

## Magical Systems
If you're planning on building a game with magic, spend some time deciding the rules of magic in your setting. Where does the energy for magic come from? How is it channeled? What does it cost to use magic? Who can use magic, either practically or legally? How has magic affected society? The environment? Are there classes of magic or is it vague and open-ended? How does one learn magic? Answering some basic questions will save you a lot of time later on and can help when building up your setting.

## Sex
While not all players of _dnduet_ will be comfortable including the following rules in their game, it can be a healthy and fulfilling way to experience sexual fantasies in a safe setting. Should you and your players agree to include sex in your game, there are a number of options for including it:

- Simply skip past the action and make a `CHA` action roll to see how well you "preformed" with your chosen partner(s).
- Give a little detail, roll `CHA` for performance a few times and `CON` to see how rested you are afterwards.
- Go all out; take turns rolling "damage" against each other's HP with each action to get each other to orgasm and roll `CON` for a chance of getting half your HP back for a quick second round.

Know the comfort level and **specific** boundaries of your player(s) and be honest with each other about what you're willing and not willing to roleplay. Be especially careful about controversial fetishes, and consider staying away from harmful sexual practices; this is supposed to be fun, not a tool for normalizing abuse.

## Pregnancy
Whether or not you're including the "behind the black" rules for sex in your campaign, you might find it interesting to include mechanics around the possibility of your characters becoming pregnant. This might not work for you, depending on the setting you're going for, but interesting stories can arise from the sudden life-changing event of creating a new person. These rules can also be tweaked for darker purposes, i.e. parasitic alien implantation or prolonged possession.

If a character has come under risk of pregnancy, roll `1d20`:

- If you roll a 20, you're pregnant!
- If you roll a 19 and your character is 20-40 years old, you're pregnant!
- If you roll an 18 and your character is 20-30, you're pregnant!
- If you roll a 17 and your character is 20-25 years old, you're pregnant!
- If you roll between 2 and 16, your character is not pregnant.
- If you roll a 1, you're sterile and will require magical, scientific, or divine intervention to become pregnant.

### Contraceptives
If your character specifically uses contraceptives, roll an extra `1d20` for each method of contraception used and use the lowest roll result.

### Immaculate Conception
Curses, magical tricksters, flirty deities, or whatever else you're comfortable including in your game might cause your player to become pregnant without sex. Regardless, roll as normal and follow the conditions above.

### Progression
You may want to talk with your player about how a pregnancy will affect the flow of the narrative. Will you track the progress and work it into the story? Find a witch to speed up the birth so you can get back on the road with your new bundle of love? Find a safe place to hunker down and skip several months of peacefully preparing? It's totally up to you and your player(s) to decide, different people find different things fun.
