## Creating the Protagonist

1. Roll `1d4-2` for your starting **traits**:
    - `STR` - Athletics, muscle, melee
    - `DEX` - Acrobatics, stealth, finesse
    - `CON` - Durability, resistances
    - `INT` - Memory, logic, investigation
    - `WIS` - Senses, perception, ranged
    - `CHA` - Performance, persuasion
2. Learn one *F*-rank **ability**
3. Take three *F*-rank **items**

## Playing the Game
When facing an obstacle, describe the action and roll `1d20+trait`. The narrator rolls `1d20+bonus` for the obstacle and compares the results. If you roll higher the outcome is good and if not the outcome is bad. Ties result in a good outcome with a cost. The narrator describes the outcome and play continues.

With a good outcome, roll your **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's **heart points (HP)**. When its HP reaches zero, it's no longer a threat. On a bad outcome the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage and reduces the protagonist's HP. If you lose all of your HP, you suffer a major setback. After 2 hours of rest, roll your damage to restore lost HP.

## Leveling Up
When the protagonist has reached significant milestones, the narrator can let you **level up**:

1. Roll your new damage to increase your max HP
2. Increase a trait by 1 point (5 max each)
3. Learn a new ability *or* upgrade an existing ability
