# DNDuet Core Rules
_DNDuet_ is a system for building and playing custom tabletop role-playing games between a game master (GM) and at least one player. The player controls the protagonist, making choices and taking actions that progress the story. The GM is responsible for the environment, obstacles, and non-player characters (NPCs).

## How to Play
The GM sets the scene and presents the player with choices and opportunities for action rolls to move forward. When the result of an action is uncertain the player, GM, or both will make an **action roll** to determine the outcome. Action rolls involve rolling `1d20`, modifying the result with the most relevant trait score and any abilities or items being used to take the action, and comparing the final result against a target number. If the result is higher, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in positive outcomes, but at a cost.

## Creating a Character
Characters in _DNDuet_ have six traits that represent their strengths and weaknesses:

At level 1, roll `1d4-2` to set the starting score for each trait. You may rearrange these scores once. When you level up you may add 1 point to any trait with a score less than 5.

## Heart Points
Characters, as well as equipment and some obstacles, have a resource called **heart points (HP)** which represent their overall integrity. When HP reaches zero equipment breaks, obstacles are overcome, and characters suffer a major narrative setback. HP is reduced and replenished using **damage rolls**, which increases with each level:
