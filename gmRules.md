# DNDuet Core Rules
_DNDuet_ is a system for building and playing custom tabletop role-playing games between a game master (GM) and at least one player. The player controls the protagonist, making choices and taking actions that progress the story. The GM is responsible for the environment, obstacles, and non-player characters (NPCs).

## How to Play
The GM sets the scene and presents the player with choices and opportunities for action rolls to move forward. When the result of an action is uncertain the player, GM, or both will make an **action roll** to determine the outcome. Action rolls involve rolling `1d20`, modifying the result with the most relevant trait score and any abilities or items being used to take the action, and comparing the final result against a target number. If the result is higher, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in positive outcomes, but at a cost.

## Creating a Character
Characters in _DNDuet_ have six traits that represent their strengths and weaknesses:

At level 1, roll `1d4-2` to set the starting score for each trait. You may rearrange these scores once. When you level up you may add 1 point to any trait with a score less than 5.

## Heart Points
Characters, as well as equipment and some obstacles, have a resource called **heart points (HP)** which represent their overall integrity. When HP reaches zero equipment breaks, obstacles are overcome, and characters suffer a major narrative setback. HP is reduced and replenished using **damage rolls**, which increases with each level:

Characters regain HP naturally after every 2 hours of rest by rolling their damage and adding the result to their current HP. When you reach a new level, roll your new damage dice and increase your max HP by the result.

## Equipment
Equipment has it's own HP and adds or subtracts points to specific action or damage rolls. If the equipment is used on an action but the outcome is negative, the equipment takes damage. In some cases you can choose to damage an item on purpose to offset incoming damage, but only by the equipment's bonus. For example, if you would take 8 points of damage from a club you might use your +3 sword to soften the blow; you would take 5 damage and your sword would take 3. If the equipment breaks it must be repaired by someone qualified before it can be used again.
