# Storyline RPG
_Storyline RPG_ is a simple system used to build custom tabletop RPGs. Players use a character to interact with the game world, controlled by the game master (GM).

## Tropes
Characters start with 5 ranked **tropes** that describe an aspect of their nature and personality. When facing obstacles, the character will add bonus dice associated with these tropes to a `1d20` **action roll**, based on the trope's rank:

| F | D | C | B | A |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| +d4 | +d6 | +d8 | +d10 | +d12 |

Tropes can be as small as a part-time job like ***Messenger (F)*** or a descriptive word like ***Fashionable (C)***, to a complete archetype like ***Girl Next Door (A)***. If you're having trouble coming up with tropes you can simply use generic RPG attributes like power, finesse, knowledge, insight, and charm.

## Items
During their adventures characters will collect useful items, many of which are ranked similarly to tropes but with a few important differences.

| **Item** | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 |
