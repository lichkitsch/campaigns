# Storyline RPG
_Storyline RPG_ is a simple system used to build custom tabletop RPGs. Players use a character to interact with the setting, controlled by the game master (GM).

## Character Traits
Characters start with 5 **traits** which provide an extra die (based on the trait's rank) to rolls where the trait is relevant.
