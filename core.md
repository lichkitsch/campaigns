# DNDuet Core Rules
DNDuet is a tabletop roleplaying game for two: the **player** controls the protagonist by reacting to the events of the story, as described by the **narrator**.

When creating the protagonist at level 1, the player rolls `1d4-2` for their six starting **traits**:

| Trait | Abbr. | Uses |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, resistances |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Senses, willpower, ranged |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion |

When facing an obstacle, the player describes their intended action and rolls `1d20+trait` against the narrator, who rolls for the obstacle (`1d20+bonus`). If the player’s result is higher than the obstacle’s result then the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a mixed outcome. The narrator describes the outcome and play continues. When leveling up, the player may increase one trait by 1 point.

## Heart Points
Characters start with a max of 10 heart points (HP) at level 1. On a negative outcome, the narrator rolls the obstacle’s damage dice to reduce the player’s HP. If the player’s HP reaches zero, they suffer a major narrative setback. On a positive outcome the player can roll their own level-specific damage dice to reduce the obstacle’s HP. Obstacles with zero HP are no longer a threat.

Players restore lost HP by rolling their damage dice after 2 hours of rest and increase their max HP by rolling their new damage dice when leveling up.

## Abilities
Characters learn useful abilities during their travels based on their studies, training, talents, blessings, and gifts. Abilities add an extra die to action or damage rolls. When leveling up, the player can choose to learn a new ability (F-rank) or upgrade an existing ability (if applicable). Abilities can also be applied temporarily by using consumable items or other narrative devices.

## Items
Characters collect useful items that aid them on their journey like armor, tools, weapons, food, potions, etc. Items are ranked on the same scale as abilities, but most offer a fixed bonus or deal their own separate damage dice:

|  | F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Bonus** | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 | +6 |
| **Ability** | `d4` | `d6` | `d8` | `d10` | `d12` | `d20` |
| **Value** | 0.1 | 1 | 10 | 100 | 1k | 10k |

Some items deal/heal their own damage rather than improving a damage roll: roll the listed ability die and add one of each lower rank’s dice. Items can also have a max HP of XdX where X is the number of sides of the listed ability die. Items with HP break if they reach zero, becoming unusable until repaired. Consumable items take damage with each use. For value, roll d100 and multiply the result by the listed value. The narrator creates obstacles (and side characters) as items with HP.
