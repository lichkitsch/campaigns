# Magic
Spells are created by combining an **element** with a **form** and casting it using a **medium**. Elements dictate the mechanical effect of the spell (damage type, school of magic, etc.) where as form represents the actual shape of the spell when cast. The medium is the object embued with the spell that must be activated in some way. Use the tables below to create your own magic items, using imagination and common sense to develop the item's effects:
