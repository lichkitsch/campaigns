Mellen, Gin, Taliesin, and Cura√ßao made it out of Ramora through the tunnels but they were pursued by Yargai. Berezin the possessor stepped in to help Mellen escape, but Mellen turned back to help him fight Yargai.

With many in Ramora now looking for Mellen, the group must brave the forest beyond the marsh to throw the hunters off their trail.

Denitza the Druid invites the group back to her den, a cozy treehouse deeper into the forest and up a hill. She offers food and drink, rest, and protection for the moment. Denitza explains that her treehouse cannot be found unless she wills it, and they are safe for as long as they wish to stay.



- Denitza knows about kirin, knows that they bring danger and death.
- Denitza has a direct line to Baran, will only let them leave after the god of nature passes judgement.
- Baran has been watching Mellen and is interested in her story, wonders what she would do with the power of an empress.
- Oulla visits during the night, possibly during a dream? Tells Mellen not to trust Baran or any of the other gods, that they're manipulating her.
