# Entering the Temple
You hear something making its way through the brush. Shimni calls out to the group, "Get ready!" From the dark wood, a figure emerges; the old beggar from before steps out. "Ah, funny seeing you lot this deep in my forest...this late into the night..." He's covered himself in a brown woven cloak and is carrying his walking stick under his arm.

**Pilka**, king of the marsh, decides to reveal his true form for the party and stretches his back. He grows several feet taller, his limbs stretching out to touch the treetops. His face shifts and warps into a skull-like mask, ragged antlers jutting from his forehead. The walking stick transforms as well, revealing a wicked, scythe-shaped blade of shaved bone with rotting meat clinging to the top. Pilka lets out a deep, rattling sigh and settles on his haunches, his arms resting on his knees. "That's... more comfortable..." His voice is smooth and chilling.

Pilka explains that Yasmina has been taken to the sunken temple by his kin and presented to his wife **Tirtzi**, and if they wish to retrieve her they'd better act quickly. Pilka has a personal rule to let kind hearts live, but Tirtzi has taken a liking to Yasmina and wants to turn her into a marsh devil. "We are tied to the marsh; to strike us down is as useless as firing an arrow at a cloud. However, it does takes us time to reform, so you may buy yourselves some time to save your friend." (Marsh devils regenerate after an hour and reform back in the waters of the marsh.)

## The Sunken Temple
You follow Pilka's directions and find the entrance to the sunken temple waiting about half a mile from where you met him. The opening into the temple looks almost like a stone maw opening up to take a large bite of the earth. In a large circle around the entrance are many more stone pillars, now known to be Marsh Devil Eggs.

Talgat: "We should probably leave this up to the adventurers now, what'd'ya say Sveta?"<br/>
Sveta: "No way! I wanna see the temple."<br/>
Talgat: "You're been poisoned against me by these strangers, Sveta."<br/>
Sveta: "Yeah, cuz you never let me do anything fun!"<br/>
Shimni: "Quiet you two, look..."

There are two marsh devils guarding the eggs, stalking about back and forth between the pillars and stopping every so often to investigate and admire them. Party must sneak past to get to the entrance of the temple (_DEX check AF 12_) or risk alerting the devils and starting combat. Luckily there's a din of insects chirping to help hide footsteps.

**Encounter:** Marsh Devils (_D_) x2

## Entrance
The temple, built of stacked stone covered in thick, damp moss and overgrown with vines, is quite dark inside and very quiet. The floor is slick with wet earth and moss and must be traversed with care to avoid slipping. There are figures moving about in the darkness.

**Encounter:** Marsh Devils (_D_) x3

- One of the devils will flee towards the room on the eastern wall, another will drop down the hole in the southwest corner.

After clearing out the marsh devils from the first level, the party can investigate to find the remains of an abandoned halfling camp. There are three bed rolls lying around an old campfire and several chests around, though one is much bigger than the others and has a large locking mechanism on the front.

**Magic Chest:** The large chest is locked tightly by magic; anyone trying to open it will feel compelled to leave it alone until the spell is broken.

- Whetstone of Blazing Ash (_A_)
    - Used on a blade, the whetstone provides a searing edge which adds burn damage on the next swing.
- Phial of Awakening Salt (_B_)
    - Wave under the nose of a sleeping/unconscious creature to wake them.
- Thieves' ledger and clothing
- 1500gp

## Side Chamber
Following the devil into the eastern chamber off the main entrance room, a strong wall falls down between you, cutting off the path. There's a glimmer and the wall is sealed with magic, requiring a spell to unlock it (found in room below).

After retrieving the scroll and unlocking the wall, you descend a staircase and stop abruptly at the bottom to avoid falling into the water flooding the room. The devil has disappeared, likely into the murky depths. Green slime coats the walls of this room and there are several flat, stone platforms poking up from the water. They are also covered in moss and will be difficult to traverse, but there is something interesting on the far side of the room: a nest of branches and a large, strange, black shape sitting in the center, a glowing red aura rising from it.

Hopping onto the stones requires _DEX check AF 15_ for each. Failure means dropping into the murky water and starting combat with the missing devil (_C_).

Upon reaching the nest of branches, you can see now that the black shape in the center is the leathery, mummified body of a large adult crocodile. The red aura grows brighter as it peels away from the body, revealing the Willabog. The creature yawns and gently rises from the nest before floating around the room. Sveta can use her embody spell to take over the creature and give Gin his memories back. Unfortunately, she also learns how the Willabog eats memories, starting with the strongest and working back. Gin's memories also slowly return, not all at once, and his were the only memories she could recover.

## Second Level
A ladder cut into the crumbling stone wall in the corner of the room leads below to the second floor. It's even darker below, and there is a halfling skeleton slumped against the wall near the bottom of the ladder. There is a wooden chest in the corner of the room with 7sp and a coil of rope (_F_) inside. Searching this level you find a chasm splitting the room in half, with two doors on the opposite side guarded by marsh devils and a hulking marsh beast. The chasm is easy enough to jump (_DEX check AF 10_) but the monsters waiting on the other side could pose a problem.

**Encounter:** Marsh Devils (_D_) x3 and a Marsh Beast (_C_)

Of the two doors, one is easily opened and leads to a small shrine built upon an altar between two columns. There are three small bowls set upon the altar and a statue of the Willabog. To open the statue the three bowls need to have an equal weight placed in them as offering (coins, stones, etc) but if they are set unevenly a trap (spike pit, _DEX check AF 12_) is sprung. Opening the statue presents a scroll (to open the wall) and a key (to open the other door, which leads down to the bottom level.

## Bottom Level
The key turns with a loud clank and the door slowly falls into the floor. The air in the chamber below is thick and humid and there is a long stone staircase leading down into the bottom level. The staricase is unguarded, but at the bottom of it there are several marsh devils lying in wait. They won't attack right away, however, as Tirtzi prefers to fight for herself.
