# Entering the Temple
You hear something making its way through the brush. Shimni calls out to the group, "Get ready!" From the dark wood, a figure emerges; the old beggar from before steps out. "Ah, funny seeing you lot this deep in my forest...this late into the night..." He's covered himself in a brown woven cloak and is carrying his walking stick under his arm.

**Pilka**, king of the marsh, decides to reveal his true form for the party and stretches his back. He grows several feet taller, his limbs stretching out to touch the treetops. His face shifts and warps into a skull-like mask, ragged antlers jutting from his forehead. The walking stick transforms as well, revealing a wicked, scythe-shaped blade of shaved bone with rotting meat clinging to the top. Pilka lets out a deep, rattling sigh and settles on his haunches, his arms resting on his knees. "That's... more comfortable..." His voice is smooth and chilling.

Pilka explains that Yasmina has been taken to the sunken temple by his kin and presented to his wife **Tirtzi**, and if they wish to retrieve her they'd better act quickly. Pilka has a personal rule to let kind hearts live, but Tirtzi has taken a liking to Yasmina and wants to turn her into a marsh devil. "We are tied to the marsh; to strike us down is as useless as firing an arrow at a cloud. However, it does takes us time to reform, so you may buy yourselves some time to save your friend." (Marsh devils regenerate after an hour and reform back in the waters of the marsh.)

## The Sunken Temple
You follow Pilka's directions and find the entrance to the sunken temple waiting about half a mile from where you met him. The opening into the temple looks almost like a stone maw opening up to take a large bite of the earth. In a large circle around the entrance are many more stone pillars, now known to be Marsh Devil Eggs.

Talgat: "We should probably leave this up to the adventurers now, what'd'ya say Sveta?"<br/>
Sveta: "No way! I wanna see the temple."<br/>
Talgat: "You're been poisoned against me by these strangers, Sveta."<br/>
Sveta: "Yeah, cuz you never let me do anything fun!"<br/>
Shimni: "Quiet you two, look..."

There are two marsh devils guarding the eggs, stalking about back and forth between the pillars and stopping every so often to investigate and admire them. Party must sneak past to get to the entrance of the temple (_DEX check AF 12_) or risk alerting the devils and starting combat. Luckily there's a din of insects chirping to help hide footsteps.

## Entrance
The temple, built of stacked stone covered in thick, damp moss and overgrown with vines, is quite dark inside and very quiet. The floor is slick with wet earth and moss and must be traversed with care to avoid slipping. There are figures moving about in the darkness.

**Encounter:** Marsh Devils (_D_) x3
- One of the devils will flee towards the room on the eastern wall, another will drop down the hole in the southwest corner.

After clearing out the marsh devils from the first level, the party can investigate to find the remains of an abandoned halfling camp. There are three bed rolls lying around an old campfire and several chests around, though one is much bigger than the others and has a large locking mechanism on the front.

**Magic Chest:** The large chest is locked tightly by magic; anyone trying to open it will feel compelled to leave it alone until the spell is broken.
  - Whetstone of Blazing Ash (_A_): Used on a blade, the whetstone provides a searing edge which adds burn damage on the next swing.
  - Phial of Awakening Salt (_B_): Wave under the nose of a sleeping/unconscious creature to wake them.
  - Thieves' ledger and clothing
  - 1500gp

## Side chamber
Following the devil into the eastern chamber off the main entrance room, you descend a staircase and stop abruptly at the bottom to avoid falling into the water flooding the room. The devil has disappeared, likely into the murky depths.



- Filled with swamp water, stone columns poking up from the muck
- Floating deadwood make a simple bridge to a large bed made of dead plants, a naturally mummified alligator body sits at the center, almost looks asleep
- Willabog rises from the body, yawns, lazily floats around the room

## Second level
- large chasm in floor leading down to bottom level
- corpse of a halfling adventurer

## Bottom Level
-
