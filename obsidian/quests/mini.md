## Red Marshes
Flat wetlands shining red as blood, wandering Marsh Devils (F) hiding in bubbling pits, bleached bones poking up from the murky water with flesh still clinging beneath the surface

## Ramora
Ramshackle buildings piled up like firewood, wall and gates of sharpened logs, charms of carved bones, feathers, and animal skins hanging from twine lines stretching over the walkways

## The Sunken Temple
Stone brick walls caked in damp red moss and vines, stone floor littered with oxidized copper braziers, broken stone columns, and bones, the inside is dark and the air thick, damp, and cold.

In the first room lies an abandoned camp with a skeletal figure clinging to a large chest, locked by magic.
