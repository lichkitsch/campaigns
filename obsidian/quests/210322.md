## Sartak
Sartak started losing his mind and deteriorated quickly after Koumiss' initial attack and their journey to Nofuin. Cibreka feels something happened that led to his death but has no leads or suspects. Mellen could possibly use psychometry on his belongings to see if she can find out what happened? (Sartak was poisoned by a mouse maid, sent by Viktor and hiding in plain sight.)
