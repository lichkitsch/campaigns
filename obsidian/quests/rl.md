## Ramora
Ramshackle buildings piled up like firewood, wall and gates of sharpened logs, charms of carved bones hanging from twine stretched over the walkways

## The Sunken Temple
Stone brick walls caked in damp red moss and vines, stone floor littered with oxidized copper braziers, broken stone columns, and bones, the inside is dark and the air thick, damp, and cold
