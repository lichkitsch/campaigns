# Jungles of Biphate
The party has made it through the desert to the Biphatian border. Biphate is a mostly tropical climate with large stretches of jungle and green mountains surrounded by coastlines. There is powerful magic emanating from the land itself and the whole country is teeming with life. It is here that the Wizard's College and their grand archives exist at the center of the sprawling city of Ikat, built on the bones of an ancient civilization.

## Important NPCs
- **Headmaster Poxlom**
    - Simply doesn't believe the secret library should be opened without good reason.
- **Headmaster Citlamina**
    - Wants money in exchange for her key, the job doesn't pay enough to keep up with her bad habits.
- **Headmaster Usukan**
    - Wants Mellen's firstborn, then her horn, then finally will settle for some of her hair.

**Goal:** Make it to Ikat and the Wizard's College, access the library's secret underground chambers, and look for information.

## Locations

### Jungle Road
Hot, humid, loud with the sounds of nature. Road is long and has lots of turns with the land, not many walking along it.

### Ikat
Limestone buildings, old paved roads, natural integrated with constructed in a thoughtful way. Channels take clean water through the city, people are relatively friendly but ask a lot of questions. Everyone assumes anyone new is just here for the archives or the college in general.

### Grand Archives
Makes up a significant portion of the college, bookshelves for miles in a labyrinth within the primary temple chamber and extending down into the earth. Books of every category imaginable, sorted by topic and author. Wizards wandering back and forth, researching and organizing.

### Secret Archives
Accessed via a puzzle requiring several keys, the secret archive hasnt been accessed in a number of years. It isn't opened without evidence that the world at large is in peril. The keys must be acquired before the secret archive can be accessed, by whatever means necessary.

## Obstacles
- Wild Animals (F,D,C)
    - Strange beasts changed by the magic of the area
- Elemental Guardians (C)
    - Statuesque depictions of humans formed from natural elements, the security system for Ikat.
- Zanivana the Sphinx (B)
    - Zanivana is hungry for new knowledge and can be satisfied with debate over the question "why should you be left alive?"

## Secrets

|:--- |
| The library is said to be guarded by the wise serpent, or Ixehcoatl, who eats the foolish. |
| The secret archives are locked and require three keys, one from each headmaster, to open the door. The keys will not be easy to obtain. |
| The underground library is protected by a powerful magical sphinx named Zanivana, not Ixehcoatl. In fact, she was put here to replace the serpent by someone else (Ravi). |
| The ring has symbols on it that connect it with the Amari people. It's either gibberish or written in a kind of code, often done by secretive wizards experimenting in dark magic. |
| The necklace is a moon, a very important symbol to the Amari, but there's not much else to connect it. |
| Truth spells are abundant and varied, pick one and learn it. |
| Memory magic isn't just rare, it only exists in legend. The Willabog is the only creature known to have mastered memory magic, casters who try typically end up going insane. |
| Zsofia Sagra, originally Zsofia Reinhardt, was married to Sartak Sagra and birthed Shubat, Koumiss, and Gin Sagra. She was born across the sea in the Kingdom of Gras and was wed to Sartak as a sign of good faith between the two countries. |
| Mira was exiled to the astral plane by the other gods for _, which Oulla supported quietly. |
| The western continent is made up of several large countries. Magic is a little different across the ocean, focused on exchanging ingredients and charging it with magic to transmute materials. |
| Kirin |
| The Amari people were swallowed by the earth as the consequence of a powerful banishing spell known only to their own people. The destruction came one full moon after the Amari closed their city to outsiders and warned the world that their downfall would pave the way for a war unlike any seen on the planet. |
| Tarkhan's mansion is built inside of Mt. Tureq. It is heavily trapped and guarded by powerful beasts. |
