## The Temple of the Marsh Devils
An ancient and abandoned temple, sunken into the marsh and surrounded by the marsh devil breeding nests. The temple is dark and smells of damp earth and blood and, according to Talgat, the devils bring chosen prey here to transform them into their own. The entrance has been long abandoned, but the remains of a small camp sit untouched.

| Obstacle | Details |
|:---:|:--- |
| Guardian | Find a way past the marsh devil "breeding" nests to enter the temple. The eggs are really sacks holding captive travellers until their bodies fully transform. |
| Challenge | Once inside the temple the party must find Yasmina, hidden in the labyrinth of tunnels within the temple. |
| Twist | The temple was actually built in honor of the Willabog, a demigod and daughter of Mira. She offers to return Gin's memories if they drive out the marsh devils from her temple. |
