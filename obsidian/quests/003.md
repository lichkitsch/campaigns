## The Temple of the Marsh Devils
An ancient and abandoned temple, sunken into the marsh and surrounded by the marsh devil breeding nests. The temple is dark and smells of damp earth and blood and, according to Talgat, the devils bring chosen prey here to transform them into their own. The entrance has been long abandoned, but the remains of a small camp sit untouched.
