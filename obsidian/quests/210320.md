| The fog wall has lifted and Ravi's army is mobile. Fighting has started along the borders of Gras and Xailos. |
| The lone soldier that Mellen saw in Freystaria has located her and is attempting to cross the mist. |
| Gin arrives near the end of the two weeks with Shimni, Zanivana, and Oaet on board. |
| The soldier attacks the ship but is relatively easy to disperse. |
| When they land, Gin is reunited with Mellen and Zsofia! Heartfelt hugs and happy tears. |
