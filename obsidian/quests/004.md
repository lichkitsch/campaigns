# Quest Name
Gin's memories are returning slowly and not all of the memories retrieved belong to him. Unfortunately, Shimni is still not doing well and Pes wants to get her back to Oaet quickly. Taliesin and Cura√ßao agree to escort them back to Nofuin. 

The dream amulet worked for Mellen, possibly because of her magical nature, but it's drawing attention from certain individuals in Ramora, specifically the possessor Berezin. It's time to leave the city and move on to Orben. Unfortunately, Mellen and her friends are being targeted by Berezin and his men so they must split up and find a way out of Ramora.
