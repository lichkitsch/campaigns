# Wonders of Orben

## NPCs
- **Kapka** and **Anton**
  - Kindly, middle-aged inventors (rabbit and marten, respectively) travelling in a self-propelled, canvas-covered wagon. Knowledgeable about Orben but have never visited before now.
- **Viktor**; Mayor of Orben and CEO of the Quickbow Co.
  - A thin, handsome wolf in a finely-tailored satin suit holding an ebony cane. The cane is topped with a silver wolf’s head. He sits in a plush, leather chair behind a large wooden desk, so polished it could almost be mistaken for metal.
- **Mother Vilna**; Matriarch of the Valiant Order
  - A thick, strong-bodied badger with heavy footsteps and plated armor over a simple white dress. She carries a wicked-looking iron halberd and a lantern on her hip. A featureless steel mask hides her face.

## Secrets
1. Most of the tech in Orben uses Casus crystals for energy, so much so that the city is dependent on them.
2. Casus crystals are expensive and only available from the Valiant Order in Casus.
3. Casus crystals are made by transposing human souls into regular gemstones.
4. The Valiant Order worship Baran and despise Oulla, wishing to rid the world of death through a combination of necromancy and soul-transpositioning.
5. Viktor publicly wants to find an alternative energy source, but privately wants to steal the secret to manufacturing Casus crystals for himself.
6. Viktor has a secret project he’s commissioned from Tarkhan himself, a mechanical automaton.

## Orben
A large city with tall buildings, brimming with light and music. Orben is the center of technological advancement on the continent. The city is surrounded by a huge wall of smooth stone with armed mechanical guards (d8) posted every 50 feet.

### City Gates
There are four gates into the city, one at each of the cardinal directions, guarded by both armed mice-men and mechanical guards. A line of potential contestants stretches from the gate, awaiting entry and interacting with the city officials checking paperwork.

### Circle of Wonders
At the center of the city is a park-like city block dedicated to exhibiting the technological marvels brought for the contest. A river with small bridges flows in an endless circle around the individual sections of the park, separated by category: transportation, construction, production, weaponry, entertainment, and education.

### Quickbow Co. Building
Viktor’s headquarters and acting town hall, the Quickbow Co. building is the largest in the city and stands at the head of the Circle of Wonders. The building has clean stone tiles and columns, long hallways filled with artwork from around the world, and old inventions on display behind glass cases. Mechanical guards patrol the hallways and rooms, and the only way to Viktor’s office is through a special elevator.

## Casus
A village to the west of Orben, heavily defended by the paladin organization known as the Valiant Order. The order, following the command of Mother Vilna and devout worshippers of Baran, have been conquesting around the smaller southern countries and turning their prisoners into soul-transposed crystals which they then sell to Orben to fund their army.

### Factory
The factory is a front for the actual operation of the Valiant Order. The warehouse has barrels of raw gemstones, tables with tumblers and gem-cutting equipment, stairs that lead below to VO HQ, and a freight elevator for transporting prisoners down and processed Casus crystals back up.

### Casus - Valiant Order HQ
Located beneath the chapel at the center of the village, the Valiant Order’s HQ is a dungeon formed from catacombs and caves. There are many prison cells and ritual areas using magic dedicated to eradicating death by transforming souls into less destructible material.
