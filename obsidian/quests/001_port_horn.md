# Entering Port Horn
Mellen, Gin, Shimni, Pes, Taliesin, and Curacao are together on a trip down the eastern coast of the continent to reach Biphate, the last known location of the wizard that gave the trolls Ghoa and Odval the gift of intelligence. Turned away at the border of Pirea, the group headed north and found a cargo vessel called the Mariner whose capitain was willing to carry them around the Pirean shores for a fee. During the trip, Pes asked Mellen to teach her how to fight, that she might be able to help carry her own weight. The voyage around the Pirean shores took two days, and the Mariner is coming into Port Horn to drop some deliveries and, unexpectedly, the party.

**Goal:** Find safe passage through Omahore to Orben, the manufacturing and technologically advanced country to the south.

## Port Horn
Port Horn is the last shipping stop before the tiny fishing villages along the northern coast of Nofuin forest and is a notable town in the country of Omahore, a dangerous land of brigands, pirates, and hunters run by a corrupt parliment. There is a bounty out on the "Kirin of Nofuin" with posters everywhere, although luckily none of them are close to the correct description of Mellen to be of any specific danger.

### The Docks
Stinks of fish and wet sawdust, filled with less-than-trustworthy crewmen and merchants. Good place to find another boat out of town, but other countries might be less forgiving of undocumented travelers during these rough times.

### The Silver Trumpet
A typical tavern and inn operating near the river. While business hasn't been slow, the tavern owner Derby is suspicious and distrusting of the new magic in the river. Room for two costs 1gp per night.

### Madame Chichi's _House of Hearts_
A popular brothel in town, owned and operated by Madame Chichi. She has been helping gather intel about the "Kirin of Nofuin" in hopes that someone will catch it and bring it back to her; she has fashion interests in mind for the kirin.

## The Forest
The forest around Port Horn is dense, reminiscent of Nofuin. There are hunters and lumberfolk around, but its mostly untamed. A single road passes along the border of the forest, heading to the next town.

### The Alchemist's Cabin
Cyprus lives in a small shack on a hillside. In his storage room are failed attempts at creating an endless wine barrel, the contents of which are leaking down the hillside and into the river. Cyprus knows he's guilty but wants desperately to avoid punishment for his negligence.
