# Entering Landringen
Yosi and Marius have guided the group to the town of Landringen, home of the Bardic College. The headmaster of the Bardic College, Ludwig, put out a bounty on Yosi's head as punishment for destroying his tower (and several priceless artifacts within). The one he is most upset over losing is the "Eye of Lambert", a famous bardic instrument used to see through even the most powerful illusory spells. The exchange student was a spy working for Ravi and stole the eye, burning the tower to cover his tracks. Now that the eye is in Ravi's possession, he's not afraid to let Ludwig know the truth, though he is specifically sharing this so that Mellen might come to trust him little by little.

## Landringen

> You enter the village in the valley below the bardic college. Brick houses with strong wooden supports line the cobblestone street, magical lamps lighting up the area with a comforting array of colors. The smell of freshly baked bread and roasting meat wafts down the street, beckoning travellers towards the gates of the college. A small crowd has gathered at the iron gates at the base of the hill looking to gain entrance to the party.
