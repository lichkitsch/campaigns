# Entering Landringen
Yosi and Marius have guided the group to the town of Landringen, home of the Bardic College. The headmaster of the Bardic College, Ludwig, put out a bounty on Yosi's head as punishment for destroying his tower.

## Landringen
> Brick houses with strong wooden supports line the cobblestone street, magical lamps lighting up the area with a comforting array of colors. The smell of freshly baked bread and roasting meat wafts down the street, beckoning travellers towards the gates of the college. A small crowd has gathered at the iron gates at the base of the hill looking to gain the favor of the guards and entrance to the party.


## The Bardic College
> Behind the gates you can see large creatures wandering the grounds, tending to the landscaping and washing the paths, walls, and statues. Through a stone arch you enter the courtyard, bustling with activity; dancers, feasting, music, entertaining illusions flying through the air, etc. The party is "bubbled" almost immediately by the headmaster and removed from the festivities to the lecture hall. They find themselves locked into their seats by heavy gravity magic and are kept waiting for several minutes before Ludwig appears to admonish the group.

-  Yosi is being held responsible for destroying the tower (and several priceless artifacts within). The one he is most upset over losing is the "Eye of Lambert", a famous bardic instrument used to see through even the most powerful illusory spells.
-  The exchange student was a spy working for Ravi and stole the eye, burning the tower to cover his tracks.
-  Now that the eye is in Ravi's possession, he's not afraid to let Ludwig know the truth, though he is specifically sharing this so that Mellen might come to trust him little by little.
-  By revealing the truth to Ludwig, Ravi makes himself a clear enemy of the Bardic College, but it's no worse than before as he's nearly ready to enact his revenge anyway.
-  Ludwig wants to use Mellen as payment to retreive the eye, but Ravi makes it very clear that she is not to be harmed and in fact, the college would do best to join him in wreaking vengeance against Gras.

> There is a familiar warbling sound and the air grows thick and heavy. Hot, red waves emanate from the back of the room and Ludwig is lifted from the ground by an invisible grasp. Ravi can be heard, but not seen, and states his demands from the headmaster and the college before Ludwig is dropped and the party's bonds are released.
