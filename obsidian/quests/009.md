# The Tower of the Snow Ravens
Mellen has been captured by the assassin's guild known as the Snow Ravens and is being held prisoner alongside the former king of Gras, William Reinhardt. Her friends are no doubt looking for her, but it may be some time before they manage to find her and rescuing her will be tricky at best.

Berezin, Pes, Zani, Yosi, and Marius won't be able to rescue Mellen for 2 weeks. Her bump will have grown and the Snow Ravens were instructed to keep her healthy, but finding her and breaking her out are not simple tasks. Mellen can try to help with sending visions over the astral plane, but breaking out would only make things worse for both her and William.

The Snow Ravens don't have one leader and don't speak, so it's pointless to try and get any information through the usual methods. Mellen might be able to use psychometry, but the Ravens have training against mental magic.

After breaking free of the Snow Ravens the group's new task is to reinstate William to the throne of Gras and remove the corrupt High Advisor from the throne. This requires that they first make it to the capital city of Gras, Reinkastel, and enter the palace to confront the High Advisor.
