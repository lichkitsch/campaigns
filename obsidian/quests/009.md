# The Tracker
After leaving Landringen, Yosi guides the group to a nearby hunting ground to search for Roman, her tracker friend. Roman is a wolf and a hermit with little patience for strangers and barely tolerates Yosi since she brings him treats (saltwater taffy from Port Lucia, in this case). 

## The Forest
There are plenty of things in the forest to be wary of, mostly animals.
