Action rolls


## Heart Points
Overall integrity is represented by a resource called **heart points (HP)**. On a positive outcome the player rolls their **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP. When an obstacle's HP reaches zero it is no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage dice to reduce the player's HP. When the player's HP reaches zero they suffer a major narrative setback.

After 2 hours of rest the player can roll their damage dice to restore HP. Players start with 10 max HP and increase this limit when by rolling their new damage dice and adding the result to their max HP when they level up.
