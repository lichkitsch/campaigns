## Abilities
Characters can learn and use abilities to gain a bonus die when rolling specific action or deal some extra damage of a specific type. Characters start with one `F`-rank ability and can either learn a new ability or increase the rank of an existing ability when they level up.

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `+1d4` | `+1d6` | `+1d8` | `+1d10` | `+1d12` | `+1d20` |

## Equipment
Characters can collect a variety of equipment, including tools, weapons, and armor, which add a fixed bonus to specific rolls when used for their intended purpose. Tools add a bonus to action rolls, weapons add a fixed amount of a specific amage type to damage rolls, and armor reduces the damage taken from a specific damage type. Equipment can break as the result of a major narrative setback and cannot be used again until it is repaired. Equipment can be repaired or upgraded by someone skilled and capable, usually for a price.

## Items
Some objects that the character will carry can be spent to heal or deal damage based on its rank. These items include things like food, traps, potions, and more. Once these consumable items are used they disappear and cannot be restored.

| F | D | C | B | A | S |

| `1d4` | `2d6` | `3d8` | `4d10` | `5d12` | `6d20` |

## Treasure and Money
Not all objects provide a bonus or damage dice for the character to use; some things are just valuable. Treasure and money carry value and can be used for bribes, information, and transportation as well as purchasing equipment and items, or even paying a trainer (to gain a new ability). Abilities, equipment, and items carry value based on their rank and can be purchased from vendors or merchants with either currency or other items of equal value. You might also find valuables during your adventure, hidden away in chests or plundered from defeated enemies. Roll on the table below for value based on rank:

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `4d4` | `6d6` | `8d8` | `10d10` | `12d12` | `20d20` |
