# _DNDuet_ Core Rules
_DNDuet_ is a framework for building and playing custom tabletop RPGs with one player and one narrator. The narrator describes the world and events and the player controls the protagonist.

## Action Rolls
When the player is facing an obstacle, they make an **action roll** by describing their intended outcome and action, rolling `1d20`, and adding their most relevant **trait** to the result:

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, healthiness |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, aim |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deceit |

The narrator makes an action roll for the obstacle and compares the two results. If the player's roll is higher the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a cost. The narrator describes the outcome of the action roll and play continues. When creating a character, the player rolls `1d4-2` for each trait and can increase one trait by one point when they level up (no more than 5 points each).

## Heart Points
Characters (and some obstacles) have a resource called **heart points (HP)** that represents their overall integrity. On a positive outcome the player can roll their **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP and on a negative outcome the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage dice to reduce the player's HP. When an obstacle reaches zero HP it is no longer a threat. If the player reaches zero HP they suffer a major narrative setback. Characters start with 10 max HP. When leveling up, the player rolls their new damage dice and increases their max HP by the result. They can also re-roll as many dice as their `CON` score.

### Damage Dice by Level

| L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d10` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

## Abilities
Characters can learn and use abilities to gain a bonus die when rolling specific action or deal some extra damage of a specific type. Characters start with one `F`-rank ability and can either learn a new ability or increase the rank of an existing ability when they level up.

| Rank | Bonus |
|:---:|:---:|
| **F** | `+1d4` |
| **D** | `+1d6` |
| **C** | `+1d8` |
| **B** | `+1d10` |
| **A** | `+1d12` |
| **S** | `+1d20` |

Abilities can come from studying, divine gifts, natural talents, physical features, and more. They can also be temporary, gained by something limited like a potion or cybernetic implant. Let your setting flavor your designs.

## Equipment
Characters can collect a variety of equipment, including tools, weapons, and armor, which add a fixed bonus to specific rolls when used for their intended purpose. Tools add a bonus to action rolls, weapons add a fixed amount of a specific amage type to damage rolls, and armor reduces the damage taken from a specific damage type. Equipment can break as the result of a major narrative setback and cannot be used again until it is repaired. Equipment can be repaired or upgraded by someone skilled and capable, usually for a price.

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `+1` | `+2` | `+3` | `+4` | `+5` | `+6` |

## Items
Some objects that the character will carry can be spent to heal or deal damage based on its rank. These items include things like food, traps, potions, and more. Once these consumable items are used they disappear and cannot be restored.

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `2d6` | `3d8` | `4d10` | `5d12` | `6d20` |

## Treasure and Money
Not all objects provide a bonus or damage dice for the character to use; some things are just valuable. Treasure and money carry value and can be used for bribes, information, and transportation as well as purchasing equipment and items, or even paying a trainer (to gain a new ability). Abilities, equipment, and items carry value based on their rank and can be purchased from vendors or merchants with either currency or other items of equal value. You might also find valuables during your adventure, hidden away in chests or plundered from defeated enemies. Roll on the table below for value based on rank:

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `4d4` | `6d6` | `8d8` | `10d10` | `12d12` | `20d20` |
