# _DNDuet_ Rules

## As a Player
You are responsible for playing the protagonist. Describe their actions and reactions within the game world and follow the Narrator's instructions. You use your character's traits, items, and abilities to overcome obstacles, rolling dice and sometimes adding bonuses to determine the outcome of uncertain actions.

## As the Narrator
You are responsible for everything that is not the protagonist. You describe and control the setting, obstacles, non-player characters, etc. If the player wants to do something and the outcome is uncertain, call for an **action roll**.

### Action Rolls


### Heart Points
Characters, as well as some obstacles, have a resource called **heart points** (HP) that represents their overall integrity. HP is reduced and restored by rolling **damage dice** on a successful roll against a target. Characters roll specific dice for damage based on their level:

| L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d10` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

When HP reaches zero obstacles are overcome and characters suffer major narrative setbacks. Players can roll their damage dice to restore lost HP after every 2 hours of rest in a safe place. Characters start with 10 max HP. When the player levels up, they roll their new damage dice and increase their max HP by the result.
