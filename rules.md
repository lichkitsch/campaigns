# _DNDuet_ Core Rules
_DNDuet_ (Dramatic Narrative Duet) is a tabletop role-playing game optimized for play between one game master (GM) and one player. The player acts as a character living and interacting with a world that is created and controlled by the GM.

## Action Rolls
When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, the GM may call for an **action roll**. The player rolls `1d20` and adds their most relevant trait score to the result. If the total is higher than the target (set by the GM), the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes with a cost.

### Traits
Characters have six traits that represent their strengths and weaknesses. When you level up you get to add 1 point to one trait with a score less than 5.

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| **Strength** | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee attacks |
| **Dexterity** | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| **Constitution** | `CON` | Durability, damage resistance |
| **Intelligence** | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| **Wisdom** | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks |
| **Charisma** | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deception |

## Heart Points
Characters, as well as some items and obstacles, have **heart points (HP)**, a resource which represents their overall integrity. When HP reaches zero items break, obstacles are overcome, and characters suffer a major narrative setback. 

On a positive outcome against a target with HP, roll your level-specific **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP. After two hours of rest, roll your damage dice to restore lost HP. Players start with `10+CON` max HP. When you level up, roll your new damage dice and increase your max HP by the result. You can reroll `CON` dice when increasing your max HP.

### Damage Dice by Level
|   L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d8` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

If the attacker rolls a natural 20 it is a critical hit and automatically deals the highest possible damage.

## Items
Characters collect useful items on their journey that can be used to add bonus points to specific rolls, heal conditions or HP, or deal damage to targets. These items can include weapons, armor, tools, food, ammunition, poisons, and more. Some items have their own HP and take damage after certain actions. Items have their own levels that dictate their bonus, max HP, and damage dice:

|  | F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Bonus** | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 | +6 |
| **Max HP** | `4d4`<br/>_10_ | `6d6`<br/>_21_ | `8d8`<br/>_36_ | `10d10`<br/>_55_ | `12d12`<br/>_78_ | `20d20`<br/>_210_ |
| **Damage** | `1d4`<br/>_3_ | `F+1d6`<br/>_6_ | `D+1d8`<br/>_11_ | `C+1d10`<br/>_16_ | `B+1d12`<br/>_23_ | `A+1d20`<br/>_33_ |
