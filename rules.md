# _DNDuet_ Core Rules
_DNDuet_ (Dramatic Narrative Duet) is a tabletop role-playing game optimized for play between one game master (GM) and one player. The player roleplays a character living and interacting with a world that is created and controlled by the GM.

## Action Rolls
When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, the GM may call for an **action roll**. The player rolls `1d20` and adds their most relevant trait score to the result. If the final number is higher than the target (set by the GM), the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes with a cost.

### Traits
Characters have six traits that represent their strengths and weaknesses:

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee attacks |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, damage resistance |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deception |

## Heart Points
Characters, as well as some items and obstacles, have a resource called **heart points** which represent their overall integrity. When HP reaches zero items break, obstacles are overcome, and characters suffer a major narrative setback. On a positive outcome against a target with HP, roll your level-specific **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP. After two hours of rest, roll your damage dice to restore lost HP. Players start with `10+CON` max HP. When you level up, roll your new damage dice and increase your max HP by the result. You can reroll `CON` dice when increasing your max HP.

### Damage Dice by Level
| L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d8` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

### Damage Types
Damage can occur in many different ways, illustrated through the following **damage types**. Some creatures are resistant or vulnerable to specific types of damage which adds an element of tactics and strategy to combat.

| Type | Sources | Save |
|:---:|:--- |:---:|
| üëä&nbsp;Crushing | Blunt objects, gravity | `STR` |
| ‚öîÔ∏è Slashing | Bladed weapons | `STR` |
| üèπ Piercing | Arrows, spears, bullets | `DEX` |
| üî• Fire | Flames, explosions, ash | `CON` |
| ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold | Frost, water, darkness | `CON` |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è Shock | Lightning, electricity | `CON` |
| üíâ Poison | Harmful substances | `CON` |
| üíÄ Necrotic | Acid, disease, death | `CON` |
| ‚òÄÔ∏è Radiant | Light, divine energy | `WIS` |
| ‚ô•Ô∏è Psychic | Mental/emotional trauma | `WIS` |

When a creature is attacked and would take damage, they might get an opportunity to react and reduce or avoid the damage altogether depending on the circumstances. If the action roll to save from damage is successful, the damage is halved and if the save is a natural 20 the damage is avoided completely.
