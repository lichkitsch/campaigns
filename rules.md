# _DNDuet_ Core Rules
_DNDuet_ (Dramatic Narrative Duet) is a system for building and playing custom tabletop RPGs.

## How to Play
In _DNDuet_ the player takes on the role of a protagonist in the story being told by the narrator. The narrator describes environments, obstacles, and non-player character's actions and dialogue, providing the player with choices that progress the narrative. If the outcome of a player's action is uncertain they make an **action roll** using `1d20+trait` against a target number, set by the narrator. If the player's result is higher than or equal to the target, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a cost.

### Traits
Characters have six trait scores that are used when making action rolls. When creating a character, roll `1d4-2` for each of the following:

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee attacks |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, damage resistance |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deception |

## Heart Points
Characters, as well as some obstacles, have **heart points (HP)** which represent their overall integrity. When you roll a success against an obstacle with HP you can roll your level-specific **damage dice** to reduce their HP. When HP reaches zero obstacles are overcome and characters suffer a major narrative setback.

| Level | Damage | AVG DMG | AVG HP |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `1d4` | 2.5 | 10 |
| 2 | `1d6` | 3.5 | 13.5 |
| 3 | `1d8` | 4.5 | 18 |
| 4 | `1d10` | 5.5 | 23.5 |
| 5 | `2d6` | 7 | 30.5 |
| 6 | `2d8` | 9 | 39.5 |
| 7 | `2d10` | 11 | 50.5 |
| 8 | `2d12` | 13 | 63.5 |
| 9 | `3d10` | 16.5 | 80 |
| 10 | `3d12` | 19.5 | 99.5 |
| 11 | `4d10` | 22 | 121.5 |
| 12 | `4d12` | 26 | 147.5 |

Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1. After every two hours of rest in a safe place, roll your damage dice to restore lost HP.

## Abilities
Characters can use unique **abilities** to add bonus dice to specific rolls based on their physical features, magical powers, education, training, etc. Abilities can be temporary or permanent and can come from narrative events or, more predictably, from leveling up. Characters start with one _advantage_ ability that allows them to reroll a specific action or damage roll for a better chance at a higher result and unlock a new ability with each new level:

| Levels | Ability |
|:---:|:---:|
| 2, 3 | `roll+1d4` |
| 4, 5 | `roll+1d6` |
| 6, 7 | `roll+1d8` |
| 8, 9 | `roll+1d10` |
| 10, 11 | `roll+1d12` |
| 12 | `roll+1d20` |

## Items
Characters collect items on their adventure that add bonus points to specific rolls. Some items have their own HP and take damage on a negative outcome. Other items are **consumable** and are destroyed after use. Consumable items add bonus dice, rather than bonus points, to the next action or deal/heal specific damage dice. Items are rated with letter grades, as seen on the table below:

| Rating | Bonus | Max HP | Damage | Level |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| F | +1 | `4d4` | `1d4` | 1 |
| D | +2 | `6d6` | `F+1d6` | 4 |
| C | +3 | `8d8` | `D+1d8` | 6 |
| B | +4 | `10d10` | `C+1d10` | 8 |
| A | +5 | `12d12` | `B+1d12` | 10 |
| S | +6 | `20d20` | `A+1d20` | 12 |
