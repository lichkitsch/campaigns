# DNDuet Core Rules


## Action Rolls
When faced with uncertain outcomes, players narrate their action (or reaction), roll `1d20`, add their most relevant trait to the result, and compare the result with a target set by the GM. The target can be a fixed number, in the case of environmental obstacles, or an opposing action/reaction roll. If you beat the target, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a mixed outcome. The GM narrates the result and moves the story forward.

### Traits
Games made with DNDuet typically use six traits that are common in tabletop RPGs:

|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | Athletics, muscle, melee attacks |
| Dexterity | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | Endurance, resistance |
| Intelligence | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks |
| Charisma | Performance, persuasion, deceit |

When making your character, roll `1d4-2` for your starting scores. You can rearrange the results once. When you level up add 1 point to any one trait with a score less than 5.

## Heart Points
Characters, along with some obstacles and items, have a resource called **heart points (HP)** that represents their overall integrity. Players roll level-specific **heart dice (HD)** to reduce or replenish HP after positive action rolls. When HP reaches zero items break, obstacles are overcome, and characters suffer a major injury or setback.

Characters start with a max HP of 10 at level 1. When you level up, roll your new HD and increase your max HP by the result.

## Items & Abilities
During the game, characters collect an array of useful items and abilities which allow them to add bonus dice to specific rolls. Items are valued based on the bonus die provided and can be combined with an ability if it makes sense to do so.

### Item & Ability Ratings
| Levels | Bonus | Max HP | Value | Rarity |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1-3 | `d4` | `4d4` | x0.01 | Abundant |
| 4, 5 | `d6` | `6d6` | x0.1 | Common |
| 6, 7 | `d8` | `8d8` | x1 | Uncommon |
| 8, 9 | `d10` | `10d10` | x10 | Rare |
| 10, 11 | `d12` | `12d12` | x100 |  Epic |
| 12 | `d20` | `20d20` | x1000 | Legendary |

If an item is used but the action fails, the item takes HD damage. If the item's HP reaches zero it breaks and cannot be used until it is repaired by someone qualified.

### Consumable Items
Some items are consumable and are destroyed on use. If the consumable affects action/reaction rolls, roll the bonus die to reveal the number of turns the effects last. If the consumable affects HP, roll the bonus die and add one of each lower bonus dice to the result instead of your HD.

### Class Abilities
The GM can grant temporary and permanent abilities to players throughout the game based on narrative events, but characters also gain new abilities in a more predictable way based on their chosen job or class. Players start with one `d4` ability at level 1 and unlock new abilities at every even-numbered level:

| L2 | L4 | L6 | L8 | L10 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `d4` | `d6` | `d8` | `d10` | `d12` | `d20` |
