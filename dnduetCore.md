# DNDuet Core
In _DNDuet_, the narrator and the player work together to tell a story. The narrator describes the world and the player uses a combination of traits, abilities, and items to overcome obstacles and accomplish their goals.

## Action Rolls
When facing obstacles, the player makes **action rolls** by describing their intent, rolling `1d20`, and adding their most relevant trait score. When creating a character, the player rolls `1d4-2` and distributes the scores amongst their six traits:

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, healthiness |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, aim |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion |

The narrator rolls with `1d20`, adds the obstacle's bonus, and compares the results. If the player's result is higher the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome with a cost. The narrator describes the outcome and play continues.

## Heart Points
Characters, and most obstacles, have a resource called **heart points (HP)** that represent their overall integrity. On a positive outcome against an obstacle with HP, the player may roll their level-specific **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP. Obstacles with zero HP are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the player takes damage and if their HP reaches zero they suffer a major narrative setback.

Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1. The player may restore lost HP using their damage dice after 2 hours of rest in a safe place.

## Abilities
Characters unlock abilities (extra dice) that they can add to specific action or damage rolls based on their physical features, magical powers, talents, training, studies, etc. Abilities can be temporary or permanent, are gained through items or narrative events, and can be upgraded. Characters start with one `1d4` ability.

## Items
Characters obtain useful items such as clothing, tools, weapons, food, ammo, etc. that can be used to provide extra points to specific rolls, give the target a temporary ability, or roll the item's own damage dice to reduce or restore HP. Some items are destroyed when used while others break if used on an action roll that results in a natural 1.

Items are ranked by their effectiveness and obstacles are created by the narrator as items with their own HP:

| Rank | Bonus | Damage | Ability | Max HP |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| *F* | +1 | `1d4` | `+1d4` | `4d4` |
| *D* | +2 | `F+1d6` | `+1d6` | `6d6` |
| *C* | +3 | `D+1d8` | `+1d8` | `8d8` |
| *B* | +4 | `C+1d10` | `+1d10` | `10d10` |
| *A* | +5 | `B+1d12` | `+1d12` | `12d12` |
| *S* | +6 | `A+1d20` | `+1d20` | `20d20` |

Characters start with 3 *F*-rank items at level 1.

## Leveling Up
When the player reaches significant narrative milestones the narrator can grant them an opportunity to level up. The player levels up by following these steps:

1. Add 1 point to any one trait (+5 limit).
2. Learn a new ability or upgrade an existing ability.
3. Increase your max HP by rolling your new damage dice:

| Level | Damage | Ability |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `1d4` | `+1d4` |
| 2 | `1d6` | `+1d4` |
| 3 | `1d8` | `+1d4` |
| 4 | `1d10` | `+1d6` |
| 5 | `2d6` | `+1d6` |
| 6 | `2d8` | `+1d8` |
| 7 | `2d10` | `+1d8` |
| 8 | `2d12` | `+1d10` |
| 9 | `3d10` | `+1d10` |
| 10 | `3d12` | `+1d12` |
| 11 | `4d10` | `+1d12` |
| 12 | `4d12` | `+1d20` |
