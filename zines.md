    - Beat the target for a positive outcome, tie for a mixed outcome, or get a negative outcome.
4. Heart Points
    - Reduce an obstacle's heart points (HP) with damage dice to overcome them and progress.
    - If your own HP is reduced to zero you will suffer a major setback such as imprisonment, dismemberment, or even death.
5. Damage Dice
