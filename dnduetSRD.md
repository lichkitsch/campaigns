## 1. Introduction
_DNDuet_ is a set of guidelines for building custom tabletop RPGs that are optimized for play between two participants: one narrator and one player. The narrator creates a fantasy world and fills it with non-player characters (NPCs), goals, stakes, locations, obstacles, secrets, and treasure. The player acts as the protagonist in the story, taking actions and making choices that move the narrative forward. The narrator and player work together to make an exciting and interesting narrative.

### Script Style Storytelling


### Player as Protagonist

## 4. Snapshots
Although _DNDuet_ was created with full-length story campaigns in mind, there's nothing stopping you from taking a snapshot of a protagonist at a specific level and using them for a well-balanced, fast-paced one-shot session.
