## 1. Introduction
_DNDuet_ is a set of guidelines for building custom tabletop RPGs that are optimized for play between two participants: one narrator and one player. The narrator creates a fantasy world and fills it with non-player characters (NPCs), goals, stakes, locations, obstacles, secrets, and treasure. The player acts as the protagonist in the story, taking actions and making choices that move the narrative forward. The narrator and player work together to make an exciting and interesting narrative. 

## 2. Mechanics
The primary game loop for _DNDuet_ games is similar to that of all tabletop RPGs:

1. The narrator describes the setting and situation, providing the player with context and opportunities for action.
2. The player describes the actions their character will make to move the story forward and make an action roll, if necessary.
3. The narrator describes the outcome of the character's actions and continues the narrative with the consequences.

This loop is repeated _ad infinitum_, progressing the story and bringing the protagonist closer to a conclusion. The player makes use of several resources throughout the game to improve their chances against obstacles such as traits, heart points (HP), damage dice, items, and abilities.

### Traits and Action Rolls
Characters in _DNDuet_ games have six traits that represent the different approaches they might take to resolving conflicts and overcoming obstacles. When a player makes an action roll they roll `1d20` and add their most relevant trait score. These traits might have different titles, depending on your setting, but they revolve around the same basic approaches:

| Approach | Description | Examples |
|:---:|:--- |:--- |
| Fierce | Athletics, muscle, melee attacks | Strength, power, might |
| Stalwart | Durability, health | Constitution, toughness, vitality |
| Clever | Memory, logic, investigation | Intelligence, knowledge, smarts |
| Careful | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse | Dexterity, agility, talent |
| Sensitive | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks | Wisdom, instinct, guts |
| Flashy | Performance, persuasion, deception | Charisma, charm, moxie |

When creating a character at level 1 you can set your starting trait scores with either a point buy system (3 points, take a -1 to one score for an extra point) or roll `1d4-2` six times and rearrange the results. When the player levels up they may add 1 point to any one trait with a score less than 5. 

**Action Rolls** (`1d20+trait`) are made against obstacles; the narrator either sets a fixed target (we like to call this the _Air of Fate_) to beat or an opposing roll depending on the obstacle in question. Typically fixed targets are applied to passive obstacles (traps, puzzles, objects, sleeping creatures) while opposed rolls are made for active obstacles (sentient and aware creatures/NPCs).

## 3. Philosophies
There are several reasons we decided to build this system the way we did, and they center around some key philosophical stances around collaborative storytelling and RPGs in general. These stances are presented and briefly explained in this section.

### Script Style Storytelling


### Player as Protagonist


### Heart Points vs Hit Points

## 4. Snapshots
Although _DNDuet_ was created with full-length story campaigns in mind, there's nothing stopping you from taking a snapshot of a protagonist at a specific level and using them for a well-balanced, fast-paced one-shot session.
