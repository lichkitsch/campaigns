A simple, reliable TTRPG system for two.

## How to Play
1. The narrator describes the scene and provides opportunities for the protagonist to take action
2. The player describes their actions
3. The narrator describes the consequences, often requiring **action rolls** to determine outcomes

## Action Rolls
The player makes action rolls against obstacles when the outcome of an action is uncertain. They start by rolling `1d20` and adding their most relevant trait score to the result. If they use any items or abilities to help the action become successful, those bonuses are added as well. The final number is compared against the obstacle's own action roll. If the player's roll is higher than the obstacle's roll, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a mixed outcome.

### Traits
Characters have six trait scores that represent their strengths and weaknesses which are applied to action rolls based on the type of approach the player is taking to overcome the obstacle:

> Table

Characters start with 3 points to spend at level 1, but they can add a fourth point if they make one of their scores a -1. When the player levels up they may add an extra point to any one trait with a score less than 5.

## Heart Points
Player characters, as well as obstacles and some items, have a resource called heart points (HP) that represents their overall integrity. On a positive outcome against an obstacle the player rolls their level-specific damage dice, adds any applicable bonus damage, and reduces the obstacle's HP by the result. On a negative outcome, the character takes damage instead. When HP reaches zero obstacles are overcome, consumable items are depleted, and characters suffer a major narrative setback. 

Characters start with 10 max HP and increase it when they level up by rolling their new damage dice and adding the result to their max HP. After every 2 hours of rest in a safe place, characters can roll their damage dice to restore lost HP.

### Damage Dice by Level

> Table

## Bonuses
Players can use abilities and items to add bonuses to specific action or damage rolls.

### Abilities
Abilities are based on the character's physical features, background, studies, training, and talents. Characters start with one "reroll" ability at level 1 which allows them to reroll a specific action or damage roll for a chance at a higher result. Other abilities add a bonus die to a specific roll based on the level the ability is obtained:

> Table

### Items
Characters collect items on their adventure that add bonus points to a roll, provide temporary abilities, or deal/heal a specific amount of damage based on the item's rank:

> Table

Consumable items have HP and take damage on each use to simulate scarcity. When a consumable's HP reaches zero it runs empty. Other items break if the `1d20` roll they are used on results in a natural 1. Characters start with 3 F-rank items and `1d00` money.

## Leveling Up
When the protagonist reaches narrative milestones the narrator can approve a level up. The player rolls their new damage dice to increase their character's max HP, adds a point to any one trait score (no more than 5 each), and adds a new ability to their character's sheet. If the player decides to upgrade an ability instead, they may take a new ability in place of the one being upgraded. For example, if they upgrade a `1d4` ability to `1d6`, they may take a new `1d4` ability in its place.
