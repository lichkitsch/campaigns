# *DNDuet* Core
*DNDuet* (Dramatic Narrative Duet) is a framework for building tabletop RPGs for one narrator and one player. The narrator describes the world and events of the story while the player controls the protagonist.

When facing an obstacle, the player makes an **action roll** by describing their intention, rolling `1d20`, and adding their most relevant trait to the result. The narrator rolls `1d20`, adds the obstacle's bonus, and compares both results. If the player's result is higher the outcome is positive and if not the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a cost. When creating a character, roll `1d4‚Äê2` for the following six traits

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, healthiness |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, aim |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deceit |

Characters gain +1 to one trait score (no more than +5) when they gain a level.

## Heart Points
If the obstacle has heart points (HP) and the outcome is positive, the player rolls damage dice to reduce the obstacle's HP. Obstacles with zero HP are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the narrator rolls damage dice to reduce the character's HP. Characters with zero HP suffer a major narrative setback such as permanent injuries, lost or broken equipment, or even death (if allowed by the player). Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1 and increase their limit by rolling their new damage dice when they gain a level:

| L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d10` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

## Abilities
Characters learn abilities that allow them to add a bonus die to specific action or damage rolls. Abilities can be combat tactics, professional skills, or even magical spells. Characters start with one `F`-rank ability and either learn a new ability or increase the rank of an exisiting ability when they gain a level:

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `+1d4` | `+1d6` | `+1d8` | `+1d10` | `+1d12` | `+1d20` |

## Equipment
Characters will collect tools, weapons, and armor that help them on their adventure. Each piece of equipment adds a fixed bonus to a specific roll when used for its intended purpose:

| Category | Usage |
| ---:|:--- |
| Tools | Add a fixed bonus to an action when used for its purpose. |
| Weapons | Add a fixed amount of a specific damage type to damage rolls when used. |
| Armor | Reduce damage taken by a specific damage type by a fixed amount. |

The bonus or points of damage provided by the tool, weapon, or armor is based on it's rank:

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

Equipment can break as the result of narrative events or a major narrative setback (possibly brought on by the player's HP reaching zero). Broken equipment cannot be used for it's beneficial properties until it has been repaired or restored by someone capable.

## Items
Along with equipment, characters can collect and use various items to deal damage, heal HP, or just to hold value. These items are spent when used and can usually be bought or found as multiples.

| Category | Usage |
| ---:|:--- |
| Food | Roll dice to restore HP when consumed. |
| Traps | Roll dice to reduce a target's HP. |
| Treasure | Carries value and can be used to trade for other items, information, transportation, etc. |

Like equipment, the item's rank dictates its damage dice:

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4 DMG` | `2d6 DMG` | `3d8 DMG` | `4d10 DMG` | `5d12 DMG` | `6d20 DMG` |

The narrator will reward the player with items and temporary abilities as the result of narrative events and, when they reach significant milestones, allow the player to gain a level.
