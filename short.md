# *DNDuet* Core
*DNDuet* (Dramatic Narrative Duet) is a framework for building tabletop RPGs for one narrator and one player. The narrator describes the world and events of the story while the player controls the protagonist.

When facing an obstacle, the player makes an **action roll** by describing their intention, rolling `1d20`, and adding their most relevant trait to the result. The narrator rolls `1d20`, adds the obstacle's bonus, and compares both results. If the player's result is higher the outcome is positive and if not the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a cost. When creating a character, roll `1d4‚Äê2` for the following six traits

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, healthiness |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, aim |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deceit |

Characters gain +1 to one trait score (no more than +5) when they gain a level.

## Heart Points
If the obstacle has heart points (HP) and the outcome is positive, the player rolls damage dice to reduce the obstacle's HP. Obstacles with zero HP are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the narrator rolls damage dice to reduce the character's HP. Characters with zero HP suffer a major narrative setback such as permanent injuries, lost or broken equipment, or even death (if allowed by the player). Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1 and increase their limit by rolling their new damage dice when they gain a level:

| L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d10` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

## Abilities
Characters learn abilities that allow them to add a bonus die to specific action or damage rolls. Abilities can be combat tactics, professional skills, or even magical spells. Characters start with one `F`-rank ability and either learn a new ability or increase the rank of an exisiting ability when they gain a level:

| F | D | C | B | A | S |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `+1d4` | `+1d6` | `+1d8` | `+1d10` | `+1d12` | `+1d20` |

## Items
There are six categories of items characters can use to help improve their odds when overcoming obstacles during their adventure.

| Category | Usage |
| ---:|:--- |
| Food | Roll specific damage dice to restore HP when consumed. |
| Traps | Roll specific damage dice to reduce HP when used against a target. |
| Tools | Add a fixed bonus/penalty to specific actions when used for its purpose. |
| Weapons | Add a fixed amount of a specific damage type to damage rolls when used. |
| Potions/Scrolls | Heal HP (like food), deal damage (like traps), or add a temporary ability when used. |
| Treasure | Carries value and can be used to trade for other items, information, transportation, etc. |

Tools include things like rope and flashlights, but also magic jewelry or other armor that protects against a few points of a specific damage type.

Follow the rankings below when designing items for your game. If an item adds a temporary ability, like a potion, use the scale from the previous section. Some items are consumable and are destroyed when used, such as food or potions, and may come packaged in bundles. Other items can be broken, stolen, or lost as a result of a major narrative setback.

| Rank | Item Bonus | Item Damage | Value |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `F` | +/- 1 | `1d4 HP` | `4d4` |
| `D` | +/- 2 | `2d6 HP` | `6d6` |
| `C` | +/- 3 | `3d8 HP` | `8d8` |
| `B` | +/- 4 | `4d10 HP` | `10d10` |
| `A` | +/- 5 | `5d12 HP` | `12d12` |
| `S` | +/- 6 | `6d20 HP` | `20d20` |
