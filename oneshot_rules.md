# Storyline RPG
_Storyline RPG_ is a simple system used to build custom tabletop RPGs. Players use a character to interact with the game world, controlled by the game master (GM). When the characters encounter obstacles in their way, the player will make an **action roll** against the GM to discover the outcome of the character's actions. Action rolls 

## Tropes
Characters start with 5 ranked **tropes**, words or phrases that help describe who your character is and how they solve problems. These can be as small as a part-time job (***Bartender***) or a single word (***Practical***), to something as wide as an actual character trope (***Girl Next Door***). If you're having trouble coming up with interesting tropes, start simple with 5 generic attributes like muscle, finesse, knowledge, insight, and charm. When facing obstacles, the player will add bonus dice associated with these tropes to **action rolls**, based on the trope's rank:

| F | D | C | B | A |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| +d4 | +d6 | +d8 | +d10 | +d12 |

## Items
During their adventures characters will collect useful items, many of which are ranked similarly to tropes but with a few important differences. First, items add flat increases rather than dice rolls:

| F | D | C | B | A |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 |
