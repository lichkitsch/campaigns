## Why another RPG?


## Overcoming Obstacles
While the player is pursuing their goals the narrator presents **obstacles**: creatures, objects, and events preventing the protagonist from getting what they want. When the player faces an obstacle they do so by making **action rolls**.

### Action Rolls
To overcome an obstacle the player must first describe their intentions. The narrator rolls `1d20` for the obstacle, adding its bonus to set the target. The player then rolls `1d20` and adds the most relevant of their six trait scores to the result. When creating a character, the player rolls `1d4-2` six times and distributes the results amongst the following traits:

> TRAIT TABLE

If the player beats the target the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes with a cost. The narrator describes the outcome and play continues.

### Heart Points
Characters, as well as some obstacles, have a resource called **heart points (HP)** that represent their overall integrity. On a positive outcome against an obstacle, the player can roll their level-specific **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP:

> DAMAGE TABLE

When an obstacle's HP is depleted, the player overcomes it and can move on to the next challenge. On a negative outcome, the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage and reduces the player's HP. If a player runs out of HP, they suffer a major narrative setback.

Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1 and increase this limit when they level up. After 2 hours of rest in a safe place, the player can roll their damage dice to restore lost HP.

## Applying Bonuses
Players improve their chances when facing obstacles by using unique abilities and useful items collected on their adventure to add bonuses to specific actions.

### Abilities
Characters learn and develop unique skills and talents thanks to their physical features, studies, training, magic, etc. These **abilities** allow them to add a bonus die to specific actions, representing their added skill in a particular area. Abilities are ranked like items and can be granted temporarily or permanently by items and narrative events. Characters start with one *F*-rank ability at level 1 and each new level comes with the opportunity to learn a new ability or upgrade an existing one.

### Items
During the game the protagonist will collect tools, clothes, weapons, and other objects that will help them with overcoming obstacles.
