The Boot overhear Eileen talking with Roosevelt about how they're running low on supplies in the cookhouse and the delivery wagon still hasn't arrived. If the delivery doesn't show up the kids will be left eating nothing but oat porridge for the summer. Roosevelt is upset because he was excited to cook exciting and interesting dishes for the campers.
