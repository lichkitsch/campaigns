# Fronts

## Structure
There should be several fronts running at any one time, with varying levels of interest and risk to the party/protag. Plan for two major and two minor fronts, with side quests available for breathing room between major story arcs. Fronts describe a group or individual with a goal, the steps they must take to accomplish their goal, and the consequences should they succeed. This can then be broken down into individual quests, then broken down further into encounters.

## Quest Ranks
Each front will follow a typical story structure, with each quest ending on a milestone. Each of these milestones follows the same ranking as items, moves, etc.

| Rank | Milestone | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| F | The&nbsp;Catalyst | The threat is introduced and the player now knows that something is happening that must be stopped. |
| D | The&nbsp;Shadow | The threat is growing in power and the player receives a reminder of what is at stake. |
| C | The&nbsp;Twist | Things are not what they seem; the player receives new information that changes their perspective of the threat. |
| B | The&nbsp;Darkness | The threat is more dangerous than ever and something happens that reinforces the consequences of failure. |
| A | The&nbsp;Revelation | The player uncovers one last piece of information, all that's left is to put an end to the threat. |
| S | The&nbsp;Battle | This is the last chance, the final battle between the player and the danger. If the player fails here, the fallout will be devastating. Make it epic. |
