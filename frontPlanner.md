# Fronts

## Structure
There should be several fronts running at any one time, with varying levels of interest and risk to the party/protag. Plan for two major and two minor fronts, with side quests available for breathing room between major story arcs. Fronts describe a group or individual with a goal, the steps they must take to accomplish their goal, and the consequences should they succeed. This can then be broken down into individual quests, then broken down further into encounters.

## Front Milestones (Quests)
Each front will follow a typical story structure, with each quest ending on a milestone. Each of these milestones follows the same ranking as items, moves, etc.

| Rank | Milestone | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| F | The&nbsp;Catalyst | The threat is introduced and the player now knows that something is happening that must be stopped. |
| D | The&nbsp;Shadow | The threat is growing in power and the player receives a reminder of what is at stake. |
| C | The&nbsp;Twist | Things are not what they seem; the player receives new information that changes their perspective of the threat. |
| B | The&nbsp;Darkness | The threat is more dangerous than ever and something happens that reinforces the consequences of failure. |
| A | The&nbsp;Revelation | The player uncovers one last piece of information, all that's left is to put an end to the threat. |
| S | The&nbsp;Battle | This is the last chance, the final battle between the player and the danger. If the player fails here, the fallout will be devastating. Make it epic. |

## Quest Milestones (Encounters)

| Rank | Milestone | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| F | Hook | Something happens to draw the player's attention and make them care about the situation. Make it clear that there will be consequences for ignoring the call to action, and follow through with the consequences if they choose to ignore it. Prepare NPCs to interact with and interesting places to explore before things get real. |
| D | Guardian | The way is shut by something or someone and the party has some obstacle to overcome to enter the quest location. |
| C | Challenge | Some obstacle stands between the player and their goal (a puzzle, enemies, or both) and they must use their skills and prowess to overcome it to move on.  |
| B | Twist | Something about the goal isn't as it seems and the truth is revealed to the player; there is more going on than they were led to believe. |
| A | Boss Fight | There is one last huge obstacle to overcome before the goal is reached and the player can receive their reward, if they survive. |
| S | Revelation | The resolution of the boss fight reveals some final perspective on the situation, the milestone within the larger front, and provides a clue to the next course of action. |
