# Classes
_DNDuet_ tries to stay away from providing specific jobs or classes; you know your character best and the rules provided will do most of the work to keep things balanced, although abilities and items should still be approved by the narrator. That being said, below are a few examples of classes and possible abilities that might be learned by members of the class..
