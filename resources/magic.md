## Casting Spells
Many spells require specific ingredients and concentration to cast. The ingredients required are based on the four elements:

### Earth
Spell components representing earth are the easiest and most difficult to come by, depending on your needs. The required ingredient can range from a handful or dirt or sand to a flawless gemstone or rare crystal, and the required component is nearly always destroyed when the spell is cast. In blood magic, bones represent the element of earth.

### Fire
Fire representations are usually as simple as applying heat or flame to the second spell ingredient, but the source of heat might be a component to the spell in-and-of itself. Like the One Ring required the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it, the caster might be required to heat an object with their own body for a certain period of time, drop it into a specific pool of molten rock, or even sacrifice a cherised object to flame for the spell to work. In blood magic, meat and offal represent the element of fire.

### Water
Water might be abundant, but much like with fire the water-based liquid required for the spell might be more specific and harder to obtain than first thought. A cup of clear water left to soak in the light of a full moon, a phial of tears from a sacred figure, or even a specific amount of blood from the caster (or sacrificial victim) might be required to cast the spell in question. In blood magic, unsurprisingly, blood represents the element of water.

### Air
The two most common methods of including the element of air into a spell are speaking a "true name" or consuming the other spell ingredient. Woven into the fabric of reality is a language that some claim to be older than universe itself, used to speak the whole of creation into existence by a nameless, forgotten deity. Every object in the universe is given a secret name in this ancient tongue upon its creation and speaking this true name gives the caster power over the object. The caster might also design the spell to require a physical component that represents the air element such as smoke, feathers, or perfume. In blood magic, skin and hair both represent the element of air.
