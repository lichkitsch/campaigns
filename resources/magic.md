## Casting Spells
Many spells require specific ingredients and concentration to cast. The ingredients required are based on the four elements:

### Earth
Spell components representing earth are both the easiest and the most difficult to come by, depending on your needs. The required ingredient can range from a handful or dirt or sand to a flawless gemstone or rare crystal, and the required component is nearly always destroyed when the spell is cast. In blood magic, bones represent the element of earth.

### Fire
Fire representations are usually as simple as applying heat or flame to the second spell ingredient, but the source of heat might be a component to the spell in-and-of itself. Like the One Ring required the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it, the caster might be required to heat an object with their own body for a certain period of time, drop it into a specific pool of molten rock, or even sacrifice a cherised object to flame for the spell to work. In blood magic, meat and offal represent the element of fire.

### Water
Water might be abundant, but much like with fire the water-based liquid required for the spell might be more specific and harder to obtain than first thought. A cup of clear water left to soak in the light of a full moon, a phial of tears from a sacred figure, or even a specific amount of blood from the caster (or sacrificial victim) might be required to cast the spell in question. In blood magic, unsurprisingly, blood represents the element of water.

### Air
The two most common methods of including the element of air into a spell are speaking a "true name" or consuming the other spell ingredient. Woven into the fabric of reality is a language that some claim to be older than universe itself, used to speak the whole of creation into existence by a nameless, forgotten deity. Every object in the universe is given a secret name in this ancient tongue upon its creation and speaking this true name gives the caster power over the object. The caster might also design the spell to require a physical component that represents the air element such as smoke, feathers, or perfume. In blood magic, skin and hair both represent the element of air.

### Concentration
Casting spells takes a full action; the caster cannot move or make other actions while the spell is being cast. This is known as **concentration**. For example, a caster might embue their weapon with flames using an alteration spell for extra damage, but doing so will cost them a turn concentrating on casting the spell on the weapon. Because of this, many magic users tend to travel with others and act in either a supportive or ranged-combat capacity, helping their allies from a safe distance. Also due to casting requiring concentration are magical items like scrolls and potions, developed ahead of time and spent when needed without having to rely on concentration during times of stress. 

Concentration typically requires a successful `WIS` or `INT` roll against the narrator for the spell to be cast, depending on the spell. (Remembering a specific true name would require `INT` while most other spells would likely just require intuition and focus, which is typically a `WIS` roll.)
