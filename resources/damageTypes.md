# Damage Types
Damage can occur in many different ways, illustrated through the following **damage types**. Some creatures are resistant or vulnerable to specific types of damage which adds an element of strategy to combat. If a creature is resistant to a damage type it only takes half damage (rounded down). If the creature is vulnerable to a damage type, the damage it takes is doubled.

| Type | Causes | Condition |
|:---:|:--- |:---:|
| 👊<br/>Crushing | Blunt objects, gravity | Broken |
| ⚔️<br/>Slashing | Bladed weapons | Bleeding |
| 🏹<br/>Piercing | Arrows, spears, bullets | Pinned |
| 🔥<br/>Fire | Flames, explosions | Burned |
| ❄️<br/>Cold | Frost, water, darkness | Frozen |
| ⚡️<br/>Shock | Lightning, electricity | Paralyzed |
| 💉<br/>Poison | Harmful substances | Poisoned |
| 💀<br/>Necrotic | Acid, disease, death | Cursed |
| ☀️<br/>Radiant | Light, divine energy | Blinded |
| ♥️<br/>Psychic | Mental and emotional trauma | Confused |

## Conditions
If the target is not resistant to the damage type and the action roll to attack is a critical success (natural 20), the respective **condition** is applied to the target. Check the list below for the effects of each condition:

| Condition | Effect |
|:---:|:--- |
| Broken | The blow has caused some piece of the victim to break, either internal bone structure, external armor, or some tool sacrificed to protect themselves. Broken pieces deal damage if the victim tries to move. |
| Bleeding | The victim has suffered a laceration that is causing them to lose blood. They take passive damage each turn while bleeding. |
| Pinned | The victim is pierced in such a way that the implement has trapped them to either the ground, a wall, or some other object. The victim must succeed a `STR > 10` roll to pull themselves free. |
| Burned | The victim suffers painful burns on the area of contact. If the burned area is struck again, the victim takes double damage. |
| Frozen | Frost accumulates around the area of contact, giving the victim a penalty to actions involving the affected area. |
| Paralyzed | The victim convulses, causing them to drop any held items if they fail a `CON > 10` roll and giving them a penalty on their next action roll.  |
| Poisoned | The victim becomes poisoned and takes passive damage until it either works it's way through their system or is counteracted by an appropriate antidote. |
| Cursed | The victim's flesh becomes cursed, eating away at itself until the affected area is cleansed, blessed, or removed. |
| Blinded | The victim's eyesight is impaired and they automatically fail any action involving sight until they are healed or they succeed a `CON > 10` roll. |
| Confused | The victim suffers from mental or emotional trauma so great that they must succeed on a `WIS > 10` roll before making any action until their next rest. |
