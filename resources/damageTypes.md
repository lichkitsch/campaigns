# Damage Types
Damage can occur in many different ways, illustrated through the following **damage types**. Some creatures are resistant or vulnerable to specific types of damage which adds an element of strategy to combat.

| 👊<br/>Crushing | ⚔️<br/>Slashing | 🏹<br/>Piercing | 🔥<br/>Fire | ❄️<br/>Cold | ⚡️<br/>Shock | 💉<br/>Poison | 💀<br/>Necrotic | ☀️<br/>Radiant | ♥️<br/>Psychic |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Blunt objects, gravity | Bladed weapons | Arrows, spears, bullets | Flames, explosions | Frost, water, darkness | Lightning, electricity | Harmful substances | Acid, disease, death | Light, divine energy | Mental and emotional trauma |
| `STR`&nbsp;`DEX` | `STR`&nbsp;`DEX` | `STR`&nbsp;`DEX` | `DEX` | `CON` | `DEX`&nbsp;`CON` | `CON` | `CON` | `WIS` | `INT`&nbsp;`WIS` |

When a creature would take damage from an attack, trap, or spell they might get an opportunity to reduce or avoid the damage altogether depending on the circumstances and their reaction. This reaction roll is called a **save**. If the save is successful the damage is halved and if the save is a natural 20 the damage is avoided completely. Otherwise the victim takes a full damage roll and might suffer from a condition such as blinded, burned, poisoned, or paralyzed.

## Conditions
If one of the damage dice rolls critical (the highest number possible) the target takes a new **condition** based on the damage type being dealt. Conditions impose disadvantage on action rolls (roll your `d20` twice and keep the lower result) or deal a small amount of damage after every action taken while the condition is in effect. Conditions can stack, causing multiplied disadvantage on action rolls and compounding damage.

| Condition | Effect | DMG Type |

| Blinded | Auto-fail actions relying on sight, disadvantage on `STR`, `DEX`, and reaction rolls. | ☀️ Radiant |
| Burned | Take `2d4` damage after each action roll until healed. | 🔥 Fire |
| Frostbitten | Difficult to move, disadvantage on `STR`, `DEX`, and reaction rolls. | ❄️ Cold |
| Confused | Disadvantage on `INT`, `WIS`, and `CHA` rolls. | ♥️ Psychic |
| Poisoned | Take the critically rolled damage after each action roll until cured. | 💉 Poison |
| Stunned | Unable to move, disadvantage on `STR`, `DEX`, and reaction rolls. | ⚡️ Shock |
