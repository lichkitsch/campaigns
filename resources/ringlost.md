# The RINGLOST Method
When designing adventures for _DNDuet_, I like to use a system called **RINGLOST**. RINGLOST is an acronym that stands for:

- ***R***eview
- ***I***mportant ***N***PCs
- ***G***oal
- ***L***ocations
- ***O***bstacles
- ***S***ecrets
- ***T***reasures

## Review
First, summarize the current situation including recent relevant events and the status of the party. Where is the protagonist? Who is with them? Where are they going and why? This helps get you in the headspace for what's coming up next.

## Important NPCs
Next, list out the important NPCs (friendly and hostile) that the protagonist will certainly encounter. Give them names, jobs, a personality, a level, trait scores, items, and abilities. Describe their appearance in a few short, memorable features. Write down details about their attitude or voice to help ease role-playing. Most importantly, write down **what they want** and **what they're going to do** to get what they want.

## Goal
Give the player a clear, measurable, attainable goal to pursue. The goal might be a red herring or open up to reveal twists and turns later on but the player needs a simple, solid focus to start the quest.
