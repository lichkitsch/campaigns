# Nutshell RPG
The narrator tells the story and controls the world while the player controls the actions of the protagonist.

## Character Creation
To create a level 1 character, start by rolling `1d4-2` for each of the following **traits**:

1. Strength `STR`
2. Dexterity `DEX`
3. Constitution `CON`
4. Intelligence `INT`
5. Wisdom `WIS`
6. Charisma `CHA`

When facing an obstacle the player rolls `1d20+trait` against the narrator, who rolls `1d20+bonus` for the obstacle. If the player's result is higher than the obstacle the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative.
