# Nutshell RPG
The narrator describes situations, the player controls the protagonist, and dice rolls determine uncertain outcomes.

## Character Creation
To create a level 1 character, roll `1d4-2` for each of the following **traits**: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Characters start with 10 max **heart points (HP)**, three *F*-rank **items**, and one *F*-rank **ability**.

## Playing the Game
When facing an obstacle, the player rolls `1d20+trait` against the narrator, who rolls `1d20+bonus` for the obstacle. If the player's result is higher than the obstacle the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes with a cost. On a positive outcome the player rolls their level-specific **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP:

### Damage Dice
| L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d10` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

When an obstacle's HP reaches zero, they are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage dice and reduces the character's HP. When a character's HP reaches zero, they suffer a major narrative setback. 

### Obstacles, Items, and Abilities
Characters can use items to add a fixed bonus to specific rolls and abilities to add bonus dice to specific rolls. Items have HP and can take damage and break. Items and abilities have a rank that dictates their use and value:

| Rank | Bonus | DMG | HP | &#42;Value | Level |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `F` | +1 | `1d4` | `4d4` | 0.1 | 1/2/3 |
| `D` | +2 | `F+1d6` | `6d6` | 1 | 4/5 |
| `C` | +3 | `D+1d8` | `8d8` | 10 | 6/7 |
| `B` | +4 | `C+1d10` | `10d10` | 100 | 8/9 |
| `A` | +5 | `B+1d12` | `12d12` | 1000 | 10/11 |
| `S` | +6 | `A+1d20` | `20d20` | 10k | 12 |

The narrator creates obstacles as items with the fixed bonus standing in for trait scores and rolling specific dice for their HP and damage based on their rank. 

## Leveling Up
When the player reaches significant milestones, the narrator lets them level up. The player rolls their new damage dice to increase their max HP, adds one point to any one trait, and either learns a new ability or upgrades and existing ability, if applicable.
