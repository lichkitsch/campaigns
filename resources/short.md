# Nutshell RPG
The narrator tells the story and controls the world while the player controls the actions of the protagonist.

## Character Creation
To create a level 1 character, start by rolling `1d4-2` for each of the following **traits**: strength `STR`, dexterity `DEX`, constitution `CON`, intelligence `INT`, wisdom `WIS`, and charisma `CHA`. Characters start with 10 max HP. When leveling up, the player rolls their new damage dice and uses the result to increase their max HP.

### Damage Dice

## Playing the Game
When facing an obstacle the player rolls `1d20+trait` against the narrator, who rolls `1d20+bonus` for the obstacle. If the player's result is higher than the obstacle the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. On a positive outcome the player rolls their damage dice to reduce the obstacle's HP. When an obstacle's HP reaches zero, they are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage dice and reduces the character's HP. When a character's HP reaches zero, they suffer a major narrative setback.
