# Nutshell RPG
The narrator describes situations, the player controls the protagonist, and dice rolls determine uncertain outcomes.

## Character Creation
To create a level 1 character, roll `1d4-2` for each of the following **traits**: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Characters start with 10 max **heart points (HP)**, three *F*-rank **items**, and one *F*-rank **ability**.

## Playing the Game
When facing an obstacle, the player rolls `1d20+trait` against the narrator, who rolls `1d20+bonus` for the obstacle. If the player's result is higher than the obstacle the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes with a cost. On a positive outcome the player rolls their level-specific **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's HP. When an obstacle's HP reaches zero, they are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage dice and reduces the character's HP. When a character's HP reaches zero, they suffer a major narrative setback. Death must be unanimous.

### Damage Dice by Level
| L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 | L9 | L10 | L11 | L12 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `1d4` | `1d6` | `1d8` | `1d10` | `2d6` | `2d8` | `2d10` | `2d12` | `3d10` | `3d12` | `4d10` | `4d12` |

### Items and Abilities
Characters use items and abilities to improve specific action or damage rolls based on their rank. Items provide a fixed bonus and have their own max HP: roll `XdX` where `X` is the number of sides of the listed ability die to set an item's max HP. Items can take damage and eventually break at zero HP. Consumable items (arrows, bullets, potions, food) deal their own damage rather than improving the player's damage dice: roll the listed ability die and one of each lower rank's ability dice for dealing/healing damage. For consumables, when you roll damage make sure to reduce the item's HP by the same amount, to represent scarcity.  The narrator creates obstacles as items with the listed bonus standing in for trait scores. Obstacles

| Rank | Bonus | Ability | &#42;Value | Level |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `F` | +1 | `+1d4` | 0.1 | 1/2/3 |
| `D` | +2 | `+1d6` | 1 | 4/5 |
| `C` | +3 | `+1d8` | 10 | 6/7 |
| `B` | +4 | `+1d10` | 100 | 8/9 |
| `A` | +5 | `+1d12` | 1000 | 10/11 |
| `S` | +6 | `+1d20` | 10k | 12 |

## Leveling Up
When the player reaches significant milestones, the narrator lets them level up. The player rolls their new damage dice to increase their max HP, adds one point to any one trait, and either learns a new ability or upgrades and existing ability, if applicable.
