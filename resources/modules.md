## Overcoming Obstacles


## Travel/Rest Roll
The player rolls `1d6+1d4` and the narrator uses the result to determine the circumstances for the travel or rest:

| Roll | Outcome |
|:---:|:--- |
| 2 |  |
| 3, 4 |  |
| 5-7 |  |
| 8, 9 |  |
| 10 |  |

## Lovemaking
When engaging in carnal acts, each partner rolls `3d6` to set their **desire**. Take turns describing your intentions and actions. If your partner describes something you like, tell them to roll; they roll `1d6` and you add the result to your **sensation**. Roll when your partner tells you too. When sensation meets desire, enjoy a climax.
