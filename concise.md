# *DNDuet* Core

## Create a Level 1 Character

1. Roll 1d4-2 for your starting stats: `STR`, `DEX`, `CON`, `INT`, `WIS`, `CHA`
2. Choose three `F`-rank items and one `F`-rank ability
3. Write a short backstory and description of the character

## Playing the Game
The narrator tells the story and the player describes their character's actions and reactions to the narrative events. When the player faces obstacles they describe their action and roll `1d20+trait`. If they roll higher than the narrator's obstacle roll (`1d20+bonus`), the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative.

## Leveling Up

1. Roll your new damage dice to increase your max HP
2. Add 1 point to any one trait score with less than 5
3. Learn a new ability or increase the rank of an existing ability
