# *DNDuet* Core SRD
*DNDuet* is a system for building custom tabletop RPGs for two: one **narrator** and one **player**.

When facing obstacles, the player describes their action, rolls `1d20`, and adds their most relevant **trait** score to the result. The player rolls `1d4-2` to set their starting scores for the following traits at level 1:

> Traits table

If the player's total is higher than the narrator's obstacle roll (`1d20+bonus`) the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a cost. On a positive outcome the player might roll their level-specific **damage dice** to reduce the obstacle's **heart points (HP)**. Obstacles with zero HP are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the narrator rolls the obstacle's damage dice (based on it's rank) to reduce the player's HP. If the player's HP reaches zero they suffer a major narrative setback. Death must be unanimous.

> Damage dice by level

Characters can collect **items** and learn **abilities** to improve specific action or damage rolls. Items have their own HP and either add a fixed bonus to a roll, provide a temporary ability, or, in the case of ammunition, potions, and food, deal their own damage dice (rather than adding to the player's damage roll). Abilities add an extra die to a specific roll when used and take a turn to use. Abilities and items are ranked on a scale based on their effectiveness and value.

> Item table

When the player reaches significant narrative milestones the narrator let them gain a level. This means that the player rolls their new damage dice to increase their max HP, adds one point to any one trait, and either learns a new ability or increases the rank of an existing ability (if applicable).
