# Spellsong Tracker
Princess Ifir Spellsong, daughter of Queen Mira and Elduin, the god of light, escaped the Light and came back to Lindorwin to find a purpose away from her abusive father.

She made some new friends on her way to Steson, where her mother, Queen Mira, and half-sisters, Setra and Yuna, live in Castle Spellsong. They helped her rescue her kidnapped half-brother from a dangerous cult called the Silent, but not before he was afflicted with demonic energy.

Ezrah, Ifir's angelic boyfriend, came looking for her and meet up with Ifir and her friends while they where on a mission to Whitevale, a lumber village in the north.
