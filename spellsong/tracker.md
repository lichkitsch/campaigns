# Spellsong Tracker
Princess Ifir Spellsong is currently in hiding with Dama, Ezrah, Sal, Vela, Julius, and Ursa in Anjouville, the secret gnome city under the mountains in the north. The group is hiding from Elduin's angelic army, who overtook Steson and Castle Spellsong. Queen Mira, along with the prince, the princesses, and Lele's sister, escaped to Spellsong Island to get away from the city. Lele, Knutt, and Rutt are scouting out around Steson, lying in wait for the opportunity to take back the city.

There's something strange happening in Anjouville, however. Many people have used the phrase "gotta do what you gotta do" and while innocent, some strange events lead to the conclusion that something is very wrong just beneath the surface.
