# DNDuet Core Rules
_DNDuet_ is a system for building and playing custom tabletop role-playing games. In _DNDuet_ the player uses a character to interact with the environment, controlled by the game master (GM).

## Player Rules
Players design and control protagonists in the narrative of the game. When the player wants to make an action but the outcome is uncertain, they make an **action roll** to determine the outcome. To make an action roll, the player rolls `1d20`, adds their most relevant trait bonus, and compares the result to the target set by the GM. If the result is higher than the target, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a price.

### Traits
Characters have six traits that represent their strengths and weaknesses in different areas. At level 1, players roll `1d4-2` six times and apply the resulting numbers to their traits to design their character. When a player levels up, they receive 1 point to apply to any trait with a score less than 5.

| Trait | Abbr. | Used for |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee attacks |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, resistance |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deceit |

### Heart Points
Characters, as well as certain items and obstacles, have a resource called **heart points (HP)** which represent their overall integrity. HP is reduced and replenished with level-specific **heart dice (HD)**:

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>L1</th>
      <td><code>1d4</code></td>
      <th>L2</th>
      <td><code>1d6</code></td>
      <th>L3</th>
      <td><code>1d8</code></td>
      <th>L4</th>
      <td><code>1d10</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>L5</th>
      <td><code>2d6</code></td>
      <th>L6</th>
      <td><code>2d8</code></td>
      <th>L7</th>
      <td><code>2d10</code></td>
      <th>L8</th>
      <td><code>2d12</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>L9</th>
      <td><code>3d10</code></td>
      <th>L10</th>
      <td><code>3d12</code></td>
      <th>L11</th>
      <td><code>4d10</code></td>
      <th>L12</th>
      <td><code>4d12</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1. When a player levels up, they roll their new HD and add the result to their max HP. Players can usually roll their HD to regain lost HP after every 2 hours of rest in a safe place.

### Items, Equipment, and Abilities
During their adventure characters will pick up useful tools and skills that provide extra bonus dice to action and HD rolls under specific circumstances. There are three categories of bonus dice: items, equipment, and abilities.

- **Items** are consumable objects such as food, potions, poisons, thrown weapons, etc. When an item is used it is destroyed and the bonus takes effect immediately. Using an item takes your turn during contests. If an item affects HP, roll the bonus die and one of each lesser die and add it to the result rather than adding the bonus to an HD roll.
- **Equipment** is any object that has it's own HP and takes damage when the action it is used for fails. Equipment could be armor, weapons, tools, etc. When a piece of equipment reaches zero HP it breaks and cannot be used until it is repaired by someone qualified (based on its rating).
- **Abilities** are skills and advantages that characters receive through training, education, practice, special body features, and more. Characters start with one `d4` ability at level 1 and gain increasingly powerful abilities when they reach even-numbered levels. Sometimes characters receive temporary abilities due to special items, curses, blessings, or other narrative events.

#### Ratings
Items, equipment, and abilities are rated based on the bonus die that they provide:

| Level | Bonus | Max HP | Value | Rarity |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2 | `d4` | `4d4` | x0.01 | Abundant |
| 4 | `d6` | `6d6` | x0.1 | Common |
| 6 | `d8` | `8d8` | x1 | Uncommon |
| 8 | `d10` | `10d10` | x10 | Rare |
| 10 | `d12` | `12d12` | x100 |  Epic |
| 12 | `d20` | `20d20` | x1000 | Legendary |

## Game Master Rules
The role of the game master, or GM, is to provide the setting and non-player characters (NPCs) with which the player will interact. The GM describes the setting and presents situations to the player and controls the actions of the environment and NPCs during the adventure. This might involve acting things out, providing choices, and guiding the players through the secrets and clues laid out for them in the setting.

### Obstacles
The most important job of the game master is to provide the characters with a suitable challenge between them and their goal. The GM designs and develops antagonists, creatures, difficult terrain, puzzles, traps, and other obstacles that must be overcome for the characters to progress the narrative. When designing obstacles, there are two different ways to do it: as objects or as people. When designing puzzles, traps, and minor NPC enemies it's easiest to create them as objects. These obstacles may or may not have their own HP, like equipment, but when they deal damage they deal it like consumable items: one of each lesser die plus their bonus. When developing a major NPC it might be better to create them as a character with their own levels, traits, equipment, items, and abilities.

### Contests
When the player wants to make an action but the outcome is uncertain, it's up to the GM to set the target. This can either take the form of an opposing action roll or just a fixed number. Let's call the fixed number the _Air of Fate_. When setting the _Air of Fate_ for an action, consider the difficulty of the task at hand.
