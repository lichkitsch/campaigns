When creating a character, distribute trait dice (`1d6`, `1d8`, `1d10`, and `1d12`) among the 4 traits.

| Trait | Uses |
|:---:|:--- |
| Power | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Intellect | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Charm | Theatrics, persuasion, deceit |
| Finesse | Stealth, dexterity, aim |

When the outcome of an action is uncertain the narrator sets a target based on the difficulty of the action and the player describes how they want to carry out the action. The player picks their two most relevant traits, rolls those two dice, and adds up the results. 

If only one trait is relevant, the player rolls the die twice and adds those results instead. If the action involves one of the character's **fears**, then one of their dice must be traded for `1d4`. If it instead involves the character's **specialty**, the player may switch out one of their dice for `1d20`.

If the final number beats the target, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a cost. The narrator describes the outcome and play continues.
