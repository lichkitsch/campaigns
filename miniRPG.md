The narrator tells the story and the player controls the protagonist. The player starts by assigning each **trait** below one of the following dice: `d6`, `d8`, `d10`, and `d12`.

| Trait | Uses |
|:---:|:--- |
| Body  | Athletics, acrobatics, power |
| Mind  | Memory, stealth, investigation |
| Heart | Connection, deception, performance |
| Soul  | Perception, intuition, accuracy |

When facing an **obstacle** the player describes their action and rolls two trait dice (or one trait die twice). The result must beat the obstacle's difficulty to succeed: easy obstacles are an 8, moderate obstacles are a 10, and challenging obstacles are a 12. The player also assigns their character one **fear** and one **specialty**. If an action involves their fear, they switch one die with a `d4` and if the action involves their specialty they switch one die with a `d20`.

When creating a character the player also rolls all 4 trait dice to set their character's max **heart points (HP)**. If an action roll fails, the player reduces their HP by the amount needed to meet the target. For example, if the player rolled a 4 against an easy obstacle (8), they would reduce their HP by 4 points. When a character's HP reaches zero they suffer a major setback.
