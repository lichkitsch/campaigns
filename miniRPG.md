# MinRPG

When creating a character, the player assigns each trait one of the following dice: `d6`, `d8`, `d10`, and `d12`.

| Trait | Uses |
|:---:|:--- |
| Body  | Athletics, acrobatics, power |
| Mind  | Memory, stealth, investigation |
| Heart | Connection, deception, performance |
| Soul  | Perception, intuition, accuracy |

When facing an obstacle the player describes their action and rolls two trait dice (or one trait die twice) and adds the result. The roll must beat the obstacle's difficulty target for a positive outcome:

| Difficulty | Target |
|:---:|:---:|
| Easy | 8 |
| Moderate | 10 |
| Challenging | 12 |
