When creating a character, the player assigns each trait one of the following dice: `d6`, `d8`, `d10`, and `d12`.

| Trait | Uses |
|:---:|:--- |
| Body  | Athletics, acrobatics, power |
| Mind  | Memory, stealth, investigation |
| Heart | Connection, deception, performance |
| Soul  | Perception, intuition, accuracy |

When facing an obstacle the player describes their action and rolls two trait dice (or one trait die twice) and adds the result. The roll must beat the obstacle's difficulty target for a positive outcome: easy obstacles are an 8, moderate obstacles are a 10, and challenging obstacles are a 12.

When creating a character the player also rolls all 4 trait dice to set their character's max **heart points (HP)**. If an action roll fails, the player reduces their HP by the amount needed to meet the target. For example, if the player rolled a 4 against an easy obstacle (8), they would reduce their HP by 4 points. When a character's HP reaches zero they suffer a major setback.
