# Undertable

## Traits
Characters have four trait scores that are added to relevant actions, representing strengths and weaknesses:

|:---:|:--- |
| **Body** | Athletics, durability, melee |
| **Mind** | Memory, logic, stealth, finesse |
| **Heart** | Theatrics, persuasion, connection |
| **Soul** | Intuition, perception, ranged |

## Resolve
Characters and creatures have a resource called **resolve** that represents their overall ability and willingness to accomplish their goals. Characters start with 10 maximum resolve.

### Sway Dice
After rolling a positive outcome against a target, the player rolls their **sway dice** to reduce the target's resolve. When the target's resolve is depleted the obstacle is overcome and the player can progress. If the player's resolve is depleted they suffer a major narrative setback and a reminder of what is at stake if they give up.
