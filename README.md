# *DNDuet* Core SRD
*DNDuet* (Dramatic Narrative Duet) is a framework for creating custom tabletop RPGs for one player and one narrator. The narrator controls the world and events of the story while the player controls the protagonist.

## Action Rolls
When the player faces an obstacle they make an **action roll** by describing their intention, rolling `1d20`, and adding their most relevant trait to the result. The narrator rolls `1d20`, adds the obstacle's relevant bonus, and compares the results. If the player's result is higher the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a cost. When creating a character, roll `1d4‚Äê2` for the following six traits:

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, healthiness |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, aim |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deceit |

## Heart Points
Characters, along with most obstacles, have a resource called **heart points (HP)** that represents their overall integrity. On a positive outcome against an obstacle the player rolls their **damage dice** to reduce its HP. Obstacles with zero HP are no longer a threat. On a negative outcome the player takes damage from the obstacle and if their HP reaches zero they suffer a major narrative setback. Death, however, must be unanimous.

Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1. The player can roll their damage dice to restore lost HP after 2 hours of rest in a safe place.

| Level | Damage Dice |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `1d4` |
| 2 | `1d6` |
| 3 | `1d8` |
| 4 | `1d10` |
| 5 | `2d6` |
| 6 | `2d8` |
| 7 | `2d10` |
| 8 | `2d12` |
| 9 | `3d10` |
| 10 | `3d12` |
| 11 | `4d10` |
| 12 | `4d12` |

## Abilities
Combat tactics, professional skills, and magical spells are all placed under a resource called **abilities**. Abilities allow the character to add bonus dice to specific rolls based on the character's training, studies, and gifts. Characters start with one `F`-rank ability at level 1. Abilities can also be temporary, granted through narrative events or items such as magic potions or scrolls.

| Rank | Bonus |
|:---:|:---:|
| **F** | `+1d4` |
| **D** | `+1d6` |
| **C** | `+1d8` |
| **B** | `+1d10` |
| **A** | `+1d12` |
| **S** | `+1d20` |


## Equipment
Characters collect a variety of equipment including tools, weapons, and armor which add a fixed bonus to specific rolls when used for their intended purpose. Tools add a bonus to action rolls, weapons add a fixed amount of a specific damage type to damage rolls, and armor reduces the damage taken from a specific damage type. Equipment can break as the result of a major narrative setback and cannot be used again until it is repaired. Equipment can be repaired or upgraded by someone skilled and capable, usually for a price.

| Rank | Bonus |
|:---:|:---:|
| **F** | `+1` |
| **D** | `+2` |
| **C** | `+3` |
| **B** | `+4` |
| **A** | `+5` |
| **S** | `+6` |

## Items
Some objects that the character will carry can be spent to heal or deal damage based on its rank such as food, traps, potions, and more. Once these consumable items are used, they disappear and cannot be restored.

| Rank | Damage |
|:---:|:---:|
| **F** | `1d4` |
| **D** | `2d6` |
| **C** | `3d8` |
| **B** | `4d10` |
| **A** | `5d12` |
| **S** | `6d20` |

## Treasure and Money
Not all objects provide a bonus or damage dice for the character to use; some things are just valuable. Treasure and money carry value and can be traded for bribes, information, and transportation as well as purchasing equipment and items, or even paying a trainer (to gain a new ability). Abilities, equipment, and items carry value based on their rank and can be purchased from vendors or merchants with either currency or other items of equal value. Players might also find valuables during their adventure, hidden away in chests or plundered from defeated enemies.

| Rank | Value |
|:---:|:---:|
| **F** | `4d4` |
| **D** | `6d6` |
| **C** | `8d8` |
| **B** | `10d10` |
| **A** | `12d12` |
| **S** | `20d20` |

## Leveling Up
When the player reaches significant narrative milestones the narrator may allow them to gain a level. This means that the player:

1. Gets new, stronger damage dice
2. Rolls their new damage dice and increases their max HP by the result
3. Increases one trait score by one point (max of 5)
4. Either learns a new `F`-rank ability or increases the rank of an existing one

*DNDuet* is built to handle character progression from level 1 to level 12. You can create one-shots by locking the characters into a set level and keeping the challenges within one level of them or you can start them off at the bottom and play through a longer campaign. How you use these rules is up to you!
