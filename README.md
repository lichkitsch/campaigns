DNDUET Campaign Tables and Notes

## dnduet Core System
dnduet is a system for building and playing custom tabletop RPGs. A game master (GM) controls the world in which the player character (PC) exists. The player makes decisions for their character and rolls dice to determine outcomes of uncertain actions and move the narrative forward.

### Actions
Players roll `1d20+stat` to find the result of actions with uncertain outcomes. If the action involves another creature, the result is checked against the other creature's own `1d20+stat` roll in a contest. If not, the result is checked against the _Air of Fate_, a target number representing the difficulty of the area or task at hand. Outcomes are as follows:

| Result | Outcome |
|:---:|:---:|
| > Target | Positive |
| = Target | Mixed |
| < Target | Negative |

### Stats
Sentient creatures in dnduet have six stats which are added to action rolls:

| Stat | Uses |
|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | Athletics, power, melee |
| Dexterity | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | Endurance, stamina, health |
| Intelligence | Memory, logic, strategy |
| Wisdom | Intuition, perception, ranged |
| Charisma | Personality, persuasion, deceit |

*When creating a character, roll `1d4-2` for each stat and set their L1 starting HP to `10+CON`.

### Heart Points
**Heart points (HP)** represent the physical, mental, and/or emotional integrity of a creature, object, or task. If an action meant to affect a target's HP is successful, the subject rolls their level-specific **damage dice** and adds or subtracts the result from the target's current HP. When a target's HP reaches zero, their part in the conflict or encounter is over. HP is not only used for combat; many encounters use HP as a record of progress towards a goal. Convincing a judge of your innocence, interrogating a criminal, and even acting out a sexual encounter (if that's your thing) can all use the turn-based mechanics of increasing and decreasing the HP between two or more parties.

However, if a player is entangled in an encounter with an enemy and their HP reaches zero, the player suffers a major setback such as imprisonment, dismemberment, or even death (if it works for the story and for everyone involved).

### Items and Inventory
Characters can carry up to eight objects in their inventory. Items range from rank F to rank S and can have an effect on stats, action rolls, HP, and other areas of the game world. The ranks are explained below:

| Rank | Type | Effect |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| S | Blessed | Advantage on some rolls |
| A | Legendary | +3 to certain action rolls |
| B | Very Rare | +2 to certain action rolls |
| C | Rare | +1 to certain action rolls |
| D | Mundane | No special effect |
| F | Cursed | Disadvantage on some rolls |

### Leveling Up
When the PC has earned it and the GM approves, the character can move up a level:

| LV | Max HP | Damage |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `10+CON` | `1d4` |
| 2 | +`2d4` | `1d6` |
| 3 | +`2d4` | `1d8` |
| 4 | +`2d4` | `1d10` |
| 5 | +`3d6` | `2d6` |
| 6 | +`3d6` | `2d8` |
| 7 | +`3d6` | `2d10` |
| 8 | +`3d6` | `2d12` |
| 9 | +`3d12` | `3d10` |
| 10 | +`3d12` | `3d12` |
| 11 | +`3d12` | `4d10` |
| 12 | +`5d10` | `4d12` |

*Reroll CON dice when leveling up Max HP.

Get creative with character creation, systems for magic or other special skills, setting, themes, etc. This system was built for maximum flexibility.
