Holstead sneaks down after a little while, curiosity getting the better of him. He wants to show Diane his toy collection, but wants her to keep quiet and come up to his room to see them.

## The Second Floor
- A large, open living room.
- A beautiful marble statue of a powerful woman (Ponderance, Seren's mother) stands at the center of the room and various dark plants and mushrooms grow quietly in large clay pots.
- Behind the couch is a hallway that leads to the bedrooms and across the room is a door that leads to the other staircase.
- Clifton is sitting back in one of the couches, sleeping.

## Holstead's Room
- A child's bedroom filled with painted, wooden toys and colorful furniture. 
- A lion rug sits in the center of the room.
- Tall windows peek out behind bookshelves, upon which only a handful of items sit. 
- A toybox at the end of the bed flows out onto the floor, and Holstead rushes towards it with glee.

## The Lift Chamber
- The podium wall has two side doors that lead to an inner chamber.
- A single wooden lift hangs in the middle of the room from an intricate system of pulleys and wires.
- The lift can hold the three adventurers, but only just, and creaks and sways quite a bit when lowered down the shaft towards the tunnels.

## The Tunnels
- Dank, tight tunnels dug beneath the beach leading to the lower levels beneath Castle Cromwell.
- Creeping ghouls, black slimes, wraiths, and at least one wandering Banshee.
- Navigating the tunnels comes with the cost of dangerous creatures looking to stop you and bigger creatures looking to eat you.

Tunnel matches the bridge up above; leaky stone ceiling, watchtowers with rusted iron gates set roughly beneath the pylons, undead creatures wandering in the darkness. Light is useful for driving the smaller creatures off, but the beam causes larger beasts to become aggressive.
