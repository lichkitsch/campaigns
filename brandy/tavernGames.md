## Arm Wrasslin'
JÃ¼ngr Burgensson holds the title for strongest in the Traveler. Beat him at arm wrestling (best 2 out of 3) and take his title! He has `STR+3` and can be a bit of a sore loser. 

## Stabberscotch
Leonard Skinner is the fastest stabberscotch player (C) by the Traveler has ever seen. Another title up for the taking for anyone who can beat him at his best game (2/3).

## Flight of the Traveler

## Piotr's Puzzle
The old magician Piotr Netrebov hangs out in a dark corner of the tavern, beckoning young adventurers to his table with promises of magical trinkets and mystery. He's a liar and must be caught with WIS to beat him at his own game.

## Shanty Sing-a-long
The barkeep, Skylar, has a penchant for sea shanties and likes to give discounts to those who sing along. Start up a song and get enough of the tavern to join in and you might just win a free round off of him!
