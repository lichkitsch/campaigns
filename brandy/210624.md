# The Thunder Plains
Diane, Eric, Iosefka, and Tim are coming to the edge of Aegon and the beginning of the Thunder Plains. When they arrive, however, the plains are already gray and ashen. A towering, dark stormcloud stretches across the whole of the expanse. The road fades to an end and there is nothing but wasteland for miles. The charred ruins of a village lie in the disrance, still smoldering. The only thing still standing is a windmill, and even that is looking to be in bad shape.

A young firbolg sits on the roof of the windmill, his eyes sparking with lightning. He sits casually, gently swinging an axe and watching over the road. Vilkod has already taken on Parsnip as a vessel and fought back Seren and Helmire, sent the firbolgs to the west to the safety of the Wilding Wood, and waited.

Vilkod wants to go find Xolreit and Murulth since they are both pretty dangerous and destructive. Diane, Eric, and Iosefka are told to head South and look for Ansheri and Razgoshe.
