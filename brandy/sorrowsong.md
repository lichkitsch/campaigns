# Sorrowsong Fort

- An abandoned military outpost of crumbling stone, built on a cliff overlooking a beach.
- Broken barricades and rusty weapons, torn flags with the Cromwell crest, most window slots covered by wooden planks or thick curtains.
    - The Cromwell family crest is a golden goblet in front of a red shield with a thick, white, diagonal stripe.
- Vampires and wights sleep and wait in the darkness for victims, easily woken by activity and ready to call others to for help.

## Sebastian Cromwell - Vampire Lord (D)
