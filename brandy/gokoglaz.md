A scouting mission revealed the entrance to the secret tomb of Gok'oglaz the Half-orc Artificer, said to hold a small fortune within a hidden vault.

- Dominic the Elf Fighter wants to make money off this venture and has been friendly enough in the past, but keeps it professional.
- Toby the Half-elf Scholar is a kind soul who likes history and is working on a book about local legends.
- Addison the Halfling Rogue is a trusted friend, a bit mean but fiercely loyal and very talented.

## Guardian
The entrance to the tomb is hidden at the bottom of a pond. The pond is filled with glittering sword-eels (F) that react to movement, but the eels are stuck at the edges of the pond. They are spread too wide to jump over, but perhaps a bridge or waterwalk spell could help. The waterwalk spell does prevent swimming, unfortunately, so you would have to wait for the effect to wear off and who else knows where to find this place?

## Challenge
After entering the cavern below the pond, the party will see an ornate door, locked and trapped with various mechanisms which will require time to address. While the door is being disarmed, a construct of a minotaur (D) enters the room to fend off thieves.

## Twist
The inner chamber behind the locked door is mostly empty; solid marble walls with magic torches illuminate a single wooden chest in front of a marble coffin. There is a poem engraved on the coffin that reads:

> "Take your treasure and make haste, == your blood my ghost will taste."

Opening the chest reveals a small pile of coins and gems. Reaching in triggers a blade trap (D) that snaps the lid shut on the thief's hand. Dominic betrays the group here, taking the chest under his arm and closing the door. It's only when the first door is closed and the chest is removed from the pressure plate that the secret door is opened behind the coffin, revealing the true tomb.

## Challenge
In the hidden chamber sits Gok'oglaz's throne, upon which is a sculpture of the artificer herself with her legs crossed to form a seat and an ornate glass cock rising from her pelvis. The words "sit to enter" are inscribed above her in orcish and her face has been carved with a smug, domineering look.

There is a mechanism below the throne that collects liquid and activates an intricate series of weights and levers that unlock the door; fuck the dildo to completion and it will activate the door, but sitting on it also activates a trap that releases fighting constructs (D) into the room. While one person fucks the statue, the others must fight to defend them.

## Revelation
The "treasure" behind the vault door is a collection of sex toys built by Gok'oglaz, along with a worktable covered in her designs. (This reveals the truth about the chest). They could sell for a pretty penny, but will require time and effort. Toby and Addison offer to open a storefront and sell them in Diremonde, offering Diane her share of the profits when she comes to visit.

Dominic loses a hand to the chest. The bloody box is found outside near the edge of the pond with a trail of blood leading off into the trees.
