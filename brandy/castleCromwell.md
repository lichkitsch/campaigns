## Gnoll Market Stall

- Box of rusted metal scraps, blades, etc.
- Beaded jewelry and charms (F)
- Lightly frayed rope (20ft.) (F)
- A clasped locket without a chain (F,C) (shows parents of the person holding it but the spell is old and weak, photos are faded)
- Half a vial of Wind Rose Water (D)
- Slipbane Sneakers (D)
- Owlbear Saddle (D)

## Castle Cromwell (Exterior)

- A massive stone structure built in layers off of the side of the mountain and stretching into the ocean
- Bridge connecting two main towers (coastline passes below), shattered windows and quiet halls
- Swarms of crows during the day and bats at night flock around the spires, cackles and moans can be heard during the night, lights from fires deep, deep within the castle occasionally flicker outward

Roll travel twice for each week (3 weeks) of clearing the upper levels. Vampires more active at night and deeper into the castle, need to make it inside, fight, and get back outside before sundown each day or suffer harsher combat.

## Castle Cromwell (Interior - Upper Level)

Thanks to the size of the castle the creatures haven't made it to Diremonde or otherwise, but this section of the coast is definitely unsafe.

- A castle abandoned a century ago, filled with undead and memories of a bloody war
- Flags and shields with the Cromwell family crest on them litter the floor next to rusted weapons and the skeletal bodies of would-be graverobbers and long-dead nobles alike
    - The Cromwell family crest is a golden goblet in front of a red shield with a thick, white, diagonal stripe.
- Long hallways and grand rooms filled with rotting wooden furniture and sleeping ghouls, wraiths, and vampires
- Twisting stairwells and hidden passages lead further down, but delving deeper is ill-advised (especially at night)
- Ghouls, wraiths, and vampires wander aimlessly or rest during the day and actively seek out the living at night.
