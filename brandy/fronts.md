# Fronts

## The Composite God
The original 16 dragons have disappeared, their domains suffering in their absence.

Copengarde became a dracolich with the help of the immortal High Queen Seren Cromwell. They plan to amass power by hunting down and absorbing the other dragons, using Seren's flesh-shaping magic to combine their forms into a groteqsue, unstoppable body for Copengarde's soul to inhabit. Sensing the danger, Taldrel's daughter (a dragonborn named Iosefka), went on a journey to warn the dragons one by one of her mother's visions. The dragons she'd met with went dormant, protecting themselves from the coming hunt.

| 1 | Catalyst | Iosefka made it to Belrayn after speaking with Lugaldoth. The light over the Wilding Wood was Belrayn, he sealed Alderbright with powerful restoration magic and the tree now heals faster than it can be cut or burned. Belrayn left each of his clerics with an imprint of the plan, to be restored when the hunt begins. |
| 5 | Shadow | Copengarde wakes, his massive skeletal form wrapping around the Spire and acting as a barrier. He then possesses his dragonborn son, Helmire, and begins the hunt with Seren at his side. |

## A New World
A spaceship sits in orbit, blocking out a small portion of the night sky. The ship is piloted by neo-humans, extraterrestrials which evolved from the humans who left the earth and spent millenia living in space, mutating from various sources of radiation and extra-planetary bacteria. They closely resemble the aliens of old science fiction, with elongated limbs, large heads and big, dark eyes. Neo-humans possess enhanced psychic abilities but are weak to physical damage, their bodies more used to the weightlessness of space and minds kept busy solving algorithms and planning many steps ahead to avoid disaster. This particular ship is captained by Zoten, son of Zonine and chosen authority of Osiris Child 1. Zoten and his crew are the first to arrive to Earth after waiting for the planet to become habitable once more. They are a few millenia behind, thanks to an error in their timeline.

| 2 | Catalyst | North, half-orc cryomancer and astronomer, is investigating the missing stars. He needs to move his lab to the coast from the Zhuan Ru Tundra, ideally into the old Castle Cromwell or Sorrowsong Fort, but both are teeming with vampires, wights, and other restless undead. North contacted Elvross Winterhall to hold a competition in hopes that he can find some useful adventurers to clear the fort without bringing too much attention to the area. |

## The Old World
Deep beneath Castle Cromwell, the undead patriarch of the Cromwell line (and king during the Cromwell-Wilding war) Sir Holstead Cromwell is plotting to rise in power once again. Much of his family has been raised from death as vampires, wights, and other foul creatures or have possessed new bodies with which to make war on the surface world, and Holstead is biding his time and waiting for the right moment to sweep over the land.

|  | Quest | Prompt |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| 3 | Catalyst | While clearing out the space for North, Diane will uncover evidence that the Cromwell graves are empty; their bodies are all missing and many (if not all) of them are vampires (or otherwise undead). There is also evidence to suggest that Holstead had been a vampire from the beginning. |
