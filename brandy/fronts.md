Copengarde became a dracolich with the help of the immortal High Queen Seren Cromwell. They plan to amass power by hunting down and absorbing the other dragons, using Seren's flesh-shaping magic to combine their forms into a groteqsue, unstoppable body for Copengarde's soul to inhabit. Sensing the danger, Taldrel's daughter (a dragonborn named Iosefka), went on a journey to warn the dragons one by one of her mother's visions. The dragons she'd met with went dormant, protecting themselves from the coming hunt.

| Catalyst | Iosefka made it to Belrayn after speaking with Lugaldoth. The light over the Wilding Wood was Belrayn, he sealed Alderbright with powerful restoration magic and the tree now heals faster than it can be cut or burned. Belrayn left each of his clerics with an imprint of the plan, to be restored when the hunt begins. |
| Shadow | Copengarde wakes, his massive skeletal form wrapping itself around the Spire and acting as a barrier while he possesses his dragonborn son, Helmire. |
