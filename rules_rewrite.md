# DNDuet Core Rulebook
_DNDuet_ is a simple, flexible system for building and playing custom tabletop RPGs.

## Character Creation
To create a new character, roll `1d4-2` for the following six stats:

| Stat | Abbr. | Use |
|:---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, precision |
| Constitution | `CON` | Health, endurance, stamina |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, tactics |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, ranged |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deceit |

If your combined stat scores are less than 3, you can reroll your stats. You may also reorder your stats to better fit your intended play style, but only once.

## The Air of Fate
Difficulty is controlled by the GM using a number called the _Air of Fate_. When the outcome of a character's action is uncertain, they will make an **action roll** to determine the outcome by rolling `1d20`, adding a relevant stat score to the roll, and comparing the result to a target, typically the _Air of Fate_.

| Action Roll | Outcome |
|:---:|:---:|
| Result > Target | Positive outcome |
| Result = Target | Mixed outcome |
| Result < Target | Negative outcome |

If an action roll would affect a sentient creature, the roll might become a **contest**, with the action compared against their own opposing action roll. Players will find themselves on the receiving end of contests frequently, such as dodging traps and blocking blows.
