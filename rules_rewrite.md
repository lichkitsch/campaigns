## Ability Scores

## HP and Damage
Remove obstacles by using **damage dice** to reduce their **heart points**. On successful action rolls against the obstacle, roll your damage dice and subtract the result from the obstacle's remaining HP. If your own HP falls to zero, you suffer a dire consequence. When you level up, roll your new damage dice and add the result to your max HP. You can reroll `CON` dice when leveling up.
