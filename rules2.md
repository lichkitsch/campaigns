#  DNDuet
DNDuet is a collaborative story-telling game in which the player controls a protagonist living and interacting with a world created by the narrator. 

## How To Play
Players make action rolls against obstacles using their traits, abilities, and items. When an action roll succeeds the player rolls level-specific damage dice to reduce the obstacle’s heart points (HP).

To make an action roll against an obstacle:

1. Roll 1d20
2. Add your most relevant trait score
3. Add bonuses from abilities or items used

If the result beats the target, roll your damage dice to reduce the obstacle’s HP.

## Traits
Characters have six trait scores that represent their strengths and weaknesses in different areas, and modify specific action rolls.
	
| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee attacks |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, damage resistance |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, ranged attacks |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion, deception |
	
Roll 1d4-2 for each trait and rearrange the scores to design your character at level 1. When you level up, add 1 point to any one trait with a score less than 5.

## Abilities
Abilities are based on physical features, magical powers, training, study, etc. and add bonus dice to specific action or damage rolls. Characters start with one "re-roll" ability at level 1 that can help them get a better result from a specific roll and gain a new ability (or upgrade an old one) when they level up:
	
| Levels | Ability |
|:---:|:---:|
| 2, 3 | `roll+1d4` |
| 4, 5 | `roll+1d6` |
| 6, 7 | `roll+1d8` |
| 8, 9 | `roll+1d10` |
| 10, 11 | `roll+1d12` |
| 12 | `roll+1d20` |

## Items
Characters collect items on their adventure that deal/heal damage, provide temporary abilities, or add a fixed point bonus to specific rolls when used. Items are rated on the following scale:
	
| Rating | Bonus | Max HP | Damage | Level |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| F | +1 | `4d4` | `1d4` | 1 |
| D | +2 | `6d6` | `F+1d6` | 4 |
| C | +3 | `8d8` | `D+1d8` | 6 |
| B | +4 | `10d10` | `C+1d10` | 8 |
| A | +5 | `12d12` | `B+1d12` | 10 |
| S | +6 | `20d20` | `A+1d20` | 12 |

## Damage Dice
Characters become more effective at dealing damage every time they level up:
	
| Level | Damage | AVG DMG | AVG HP |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `1d4` | 2.5 | 10 |
| 2 | `1d6` | 3.5 | 13.5 |
| 3 | `1d8` | 4.5 | 18 |
| 4 | `1d10` | 5.5 | 23.5 |
| 5 | `2d6` | 7 | 30.5 |
| 6 | `2d8` | 9 | 39.5 |
| 7 | `2d10` | 11 | 50.5 |
| 8 | `2d12` | 13 | 63.5 |
| 9 | `3d10` | 16.5 | 80 |
| 10 | `3d12` | 19.5 | 99.5 |
| 11 | `4d10` | 22 | 121.5 |
| 12 | `4d12` | 26 | 147.5 |

## Heart Points
HP represents the overall integrity of a creature or object. At zero HP obstacles are overcome, items break, and characters suffer a major narrative setback. Characters start with 10 max HP at level 1 and increase their maximum HP by rolling their new damage dice and adding the result when they level up.
