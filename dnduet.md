## As a Player
You are responsible for the main character. Your character has traits, heart points (HP), damage dice, and a list of helpful items and abilities. Use your traits, items, and abilities to take actions within the world. When the Narrator asks, roll dice and add bonuses.

Rules are for referees, know your character and use that to inform your actions and decisions within the context of the game.

## As the Narrator
You are responsible for _everything that is not the main character_. You describe the setting, the obstacles, the actions and dialogue of non-player characters, and all the events as they happen in the game world. You describe the consequences and effects of the player's actions as they take them and check their rolls against the obstacles and targets to determine the outcome. The rest of this document is for you; use the rules and guidelines that follow to add structure to the narrative and create an interesting world for your player(s) to explore.
