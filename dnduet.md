# _DNDuet_
_DNDuet_ is a simplified tabletop roleplaying system optimized for longform, multi-session campaigns between 1 narrator and at least 1 player.

## As a Player
You are responsible for the protagonist. Your character has traits, heart points (HP), damage dice, and a list of helpful items and abilities. Use your traits, items, and abilities to take actions within the world. When the Narrator asks, roll dice and add bonuses. Rules are for referees; know your character's background, motivations, and resources and use that info to inform their actions.

## As the Narrator
You are responsible for _everything that is not the main character_. You control the world, setting, environments, obstacles, non-player characters, etc. Describe the scenario and ask "what do you do?", use the rules to work out the outcome of uncertain actions, then narrate the results. Rinse and repeat.

## The Rules
The core mechanic of _DNDuet_ is the action roll. When your player wants to do something but the outcome is uncertain, have them describe their approach. Based on the nature of their action, pick the most relevant trait and call for either a **check** or a **contest**. Checks are made against static obstacles, usually with a fixed target number to beat, while contests are made by making an opposing roll, adding the obstacle's own relevant trait score to a roll and comparing it with the player's result.
