# _DNDuet_
_DNDuet_ is a simplified tabletop roleplaying system optimized for longform, multi-session campaigns between 1 narrator and at least 1 player.

## As a Player
You are responsible for the main character. Your character has traits, heart points (HP), damage dice, and a list of helpful items and abilities. Use your traits, items, and abilities to take actions within the world. When the Narrator asks, roll dice and add bonuses.

Rules are for referees; know your character and use that info to inform your actions and decisions within the context of the game.

## As the Narrator
You are responsible for _everything that is not the main character_. You control the world, setting, environments, obstacles, non-player characters, etc. Describe the scenario and ask "what do you do?", use the rules to work out the outcome of uncertain actions, then narrate the results. Rinse and repeat.
