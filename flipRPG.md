# FlipRPG
Shuffle a deck of cards and deal 7 cards to each player. The rest stay with the narrator in a face-down stack. The narrator describes the world and the events of the story and the player controls the protagonist. When the player faces an obstacle they describe their action and play a card from their hand to represent the "effort" put towards the task. The narrator flips the top card of their stack, revealing a random challenge number. 

- If their effort is higher than the challenge the outcome is positive and the player draws a new card from the stack
- If the challenge is higher than their effort the outcome is negative and the card is lost
- In the event of a draw, the player may "buy" a positive outcome by adding one card from their hand to increase their effort, if:
    - The added card is lower than their initial effort and 
    - The two cards together are higher than the challenge number

If the player buys a positive outcome they can draw two new cards from the stack. The narrator describes the outcome and the story continues. If the player runs out of cards before the story ends, the protagonist dies.
