Deal 5 cards from a shuffled deck to each **player**. The rest of the cards are placed in a face down stack in front of the **narrator**. The narrator describes the environment and events of the story and the players take turns reacting as one of the protagonists. When a player faces an obstacle, they describe their action and make a **bet** using one card from their hand. The narrator reveals the top card of the stack as the **challenge** that the player's bet must beat for a positive outcome to their action. The narrator compares the two cards to determine the outcome:

## Positive Outcomes
1. If the bet beats the challenge the outcome is positive; the narrator discards the bet and challenge, describes the outcome, and the player draws a new card from the stack.
3. If the bet and challenge are a tie and the bet is red, the player gets a normal positive outcome.
2. If the bet and challenge are tied and of the same color, the player gets a positive outcome and draws two cards instead of one.

## Mixed Outcomes
If the challenge is higher than the bet, or they tie but the bet is black and the challenge is red, the player can attempt to buy a **mixed outcome**. If they have a card in their hand that is lower than their bet and of the same suit they may add the card to their bet after the challenge is played, buying a somewhat positive, somewhat negative outcome. The narrator discards all three cards, describes the outcome, and the player draws two cards.

## Negative Outcomes
If the player cannot purchase a mixed result the outcome is negative. The narrator discards the challenge and bet, describes the consequences, and the player does NOT draw a new card. If the player runs out of cards to play they become unable to affect the story. Depending on your theme and setting this could be for any number of reasons including curfew, injury, abduction, death, etc. When no player has any cards remaining, or the narrator's stack runs out, the story ends.
