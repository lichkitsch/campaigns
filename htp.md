# _DNDuet_ Core SRD
The following is a system reference document for _DNDuet_ (Dramatic Narrative Duet).

_DNDuet_ is a tabletop roleplaying system with a focus on collaborative storytelling in multi-session campaigns with as few as two participants.

The player takes on the role of the story's main character and the narrator designs the world of the game and presents obstacles and challenges to the player. As the title indicates, _DNDuet_ was built with two participants in mind, but that doesn't mean that you are limited to just one player. It is encouraged to keep your groups small, however, for easier game management and scheduling.

_DNDuet_ is a foundation, a collection of simple, genreless game mechanics and tables used to create custom RPG content unique to your game. It is also a `d20` system and uses the standard set of polyhedral RPG dice: `d4`, `d6`, `d8`, `d10`, `d12`, and `d20`.

## Core Mechanic
The main game loop of _DNDuet_ is simple: the narrator describes the setting, as well as the events of the environment and the actions of non-player characters (NPCs) and the player describes how the character reacts and responds to the narrative.

### Checks and Contests
When the outcome of a character's action is uncertain the narrator may ask that they roll a **check** or a **contest**, depending on the target. If the target is static, the roll will most likely be a check and if the target is dynamic it will most likely be a contest:

| Action | Method |
|:---:|:--- |
| Check | Roll `1d20+trait` against the obstacle's _Air of Fate_, a fixed number indicating difficulty. |
| Contest | Roll `1d20+trait` against the obstacle's own `1d20+trait` roll. |

If the player beats the target, the outcome is positive and if not, the outcome is negative. Ties result in a positive outcome that comes at a price.

### Traits
Characters in _DNDuet_ have six numbers that indicate their strengths and weaknesses in different areas, called **traits**:

| Trait | Abbr. | Description |
| ---:|:---:|:--- |
| Strength | `STR` | Athletics, muscle, melee |
| Dexterity | `DEX` | Acrobatics, stealth, finesse |
| Constitution | `CON` | Durability, healthiness |
| Intelligence | `INT` | Memory, logic, investigation |
| Wisdom | `WIS` | Intuition, perception, aim |
| Charisma | `CHA` | Performance, persuasion |

When creating a character at level 1, roll `1d4-2` six times and distribute the results to your traits to set their starting scores. When you level up you may add 1 point to any one trait with a score of less than 5.

### The _Air of Fate_
Static obstacles have a fixed target that the player must beat to earn a positive outcome. The _Air of Fate_ (AoF) can apply to specific obstacles and actions or even entire rooms and areas:

- Very Easy: `AoF 8`
- Easy: `AoF 10`
- Moderate: `AoF 12`
- Challenging: `AoF 14`
- Difficult: `AoF 16`
- Very Difficult: `AoF 18`

## Heart Points
Characters, as well as some obstacles, have a resource called **heart points** (HP) that represents their overall integrity. HP is reduced and restored by rolling **damage dice** on a successful roll against a target. Characters roll specific dice for damage based on their level:

| Level | Damage | Average DMG | Average HP |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `1d4` | 2.5 | 10 |
| 2 | `1d6` | 3.5 | 13.5 |
| 3 | `1d8` | 4.5 | 18 |
| 4 | `1d10` | 5.5 | 23.5 |
| 5 | `2d6` | 7 | 30.5 |
| 6 | `2d8` | 9 | 39.5 |
| 7 | `2d10` | 11 | 50.5 |
| 8 | `2d12` | 13 | 63.5 |
| 9 | `3d10` | 16.5 | 80 |
| 10 | `3d12` | 19.5 | 99.5 |
| 11 | `4d10` | 22 | 121.5 |
| 12 | `4d12` | 26 | 147.5 |

When HP reaches zero obstacles are overcome and characters suffer major narrative setbacks. Characters can roll their damage dice to restore lost HP after every 2 hours of rest in a safe place. Characters start with 10 max HP. When you level up, roll your new damage dice and increase your max HP by the result.

## Bonuses
Players can use abilities and items to add extra dice and bonus points to specific rolls. These are flavored by the setting of the game, but the basic structural elements remain the same.

### Abilities
Abilities are bonuses based on a character's physical features, experience, study, training, divine gifts, etc. Characters start with one _advantage_ ability at L1, allowing them to re-roll a specific check or damage roll for a chance at a better outcome. The GM can grant a character temporary or even permanent abilities as the result of narrative events, but characters also unlock or upgrade class-based abilities when they level up:

| Level | Ability |
|:---:|:---:|
| L1 | `Advantage` |
| L2 | `roll+1d4` |
| L3 | `roll+1d4` |
| L4 | `roll+1d6` |
| L5 | `roll+1d6` |
| L6 | `roll+1d8` |
| L7 | `roll+1d8` |
| L8 | `roll+1d10` |
| L9 | `roll+1d10` |
| L10 | `roll+1d12` |
| L11 | `roll+1d12` |
| L12 | `roll+1d20` |

### Items
Characters collect items that provide bonus points to specific rolls. **Consumables** are limited-use items that take up an action and either give a one-time bonus to specific rolls or deal damage as listed on the table below:

| Rating | Bonus | Damage |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| F | +1 | `1d4` |
| D | +2 | `F+1d6` |
| C | +3 | `D+1d8` |
| B | +4 | `C+1d10` |
| A | +5 | `B+1d12` |
| S | +6 | `A+1d20` |

## RINGSLOST
The following is a method for designing quests for _DNDuet_ games. While RINGSLOST is definitely not the only method for this, there are important insights specifically built around the core mechanics that are worth knowing, such as creating obstacles and designing magic items as treasure rewards for your player.
